  subtitle: "Director of Engineering & Tribe Lead"
  description: "I work at <a target='_blank' href='https://www.sumup.com/'>SumUp</a>, a digital payments company focused in small businesses. My background is diverse (you could say I'm a specialized generalist), but always close to digital technology.<br>I have done a bit of everything, from backend development to mobile apps, devops or team leading and coaching. I love automation as a way to optimize processes and avoid repetitive work, and working in happy agile teams - where work is a way to solve problems, and not a mean by itself."

  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I’m a very easy going, sociable, fast-learner, curious and natural leader. I do what I love, and I love what I do. I lead by example and work side by side with my teams.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I am a deliberate <em>jack of all trades, master of none</em>. My profile is a hybrid of technical and managerial experience, but always related to technological projects. I bring business and product vision to tech teams, partly thanks to having started an developed a company. I am a fast learner, curious to see how technology can improve the users experience in multiple areas. I have a strong motivation and sense of responsibility with myself, my team and clients (or peers), and people like my positive and easy going, can-do attitude.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">    
    On the technical side, I’m a <em>specialized generalist</em>, always working between different areas and aiming to develop a holistic vision on what is involved into creating a successful tech product: mobile and web development, devops/SRE,... This has involved a variety of languages and frameworks in the web-side, both in the backend and in the client side.
