&lt;p>Maybe the best thing is that I thought that the &amp;ldquo;inspirational quote&amp;rdquo; that I used to close the speech was from Steve Jobs - as I had seen attributed in Wikiquote. But it turned to be a joke added to the page - where the quote itself is from a Digimon son 🤷 (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butter-Fly">Butter-Fly&lt;/a>, in particular).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
