""
"It was energising to share some of the learnings with my peers at SumUp, and participate in the impactful global leadership program as a facilitator. Together, we make each other so much better. "

""
"Thanks for organizing DÃ©bora, Gabriel, Chinyere, Natalie, Jennifer - and Joanna for sharing the stage - it was a blast! ðŸ’¥
