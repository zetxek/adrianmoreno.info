"We tend to assume that "they probably know". But think about how many times you have been in doubt about the impact that you have on others, if you make a difference on their days; and especially: what exactly brought them joy, or frustrated who you interacted with."

"Next time that you have a positive interaction - let them know! And when you have ideas on how they can do better - let them know! "
"More often than not, your feedback will be welcome, appreciated - and you can make a difference to others - one day you might get that feedback back (which is a gift üéÅ). "
