Seizing the change: moments of change are perfect for creating new habits (or reinforcing them) ðŸ’¡"
""
"We just moved our offices in Copenhagen at SumUp, which has created a perfect opportunity for me to try new habits. One thing I have tried recently is changing my commute: instead of cycling straight to work, I take the race bike and add some extra kilometers, or I run to the office."
""
"The new office location next to Vesterport is very good for this... but so was the previous one too ðŸ˜…. Sometimes, all it takes to try something you want is to shake your routine and give it a try."
""
"ðŸ’¡ Maybe with the time changing this Sunday you can try to link that change to trying something you wanted to do... (waking up earlier to exercise, meditating routinely, taking a walk after each lunch...)
