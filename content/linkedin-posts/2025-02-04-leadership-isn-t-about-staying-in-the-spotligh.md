"Leadership isn't about staying in the spotlight—it's about knowing when to step aside so others can step up." 🌟"
""
"Being away of work and its packed schedules is giving me some quality time to experiment with AI tooling, but also to reflect. Something I've given some thought is precisely on being away. "
""
"When I first became a leader, I thought my job was to have all the answers. But over time, I realized that my greatest impact often came from creating opportunities for others to lead. Here’s how I shifted from “I’ll do it” to “You’ve got this”:"

"1️⃣ Trust > Control: Let Go of the Mic 🎤"
"Micromanaging is like trying to DJ a party while hogging the aux cord—nobody dances. True leadership means handing over the playlist to the crowd."
"Example: When someone asks you a question that you know someone in your team can answer better - send them their way. Remove yourself as broken phone."
"Will it work all the time? Of course not - but you will be there to support and turn setbacks into learning moments. Choosing the right moment to delegate will be crucial."
""
"2️⃣ Celebrate THEIR Wins (Not Yours) 🎉"
"Your team’s success is your success, and how you speak about it matters."
"Swap “I led the project” with “my colleagues' grit and talent made this happen”"
"Pro tip: Public shoutouts > private praise. Recognition is positively contagious."
""
"3️⃣ Servant Leadership ≠ Doing It All 🤝"
"Servant leadership isn’t about carrying the weight alone—it’s about equipping others to carry it with you."
"My aha moment: I used to think "it's faster if I do it myself". While that might be true - that just doesn't scale: imagine if your team had your skills spread and multiplied!"
""
"4️⃣ Your Job? Create Leaders, Not Followers 🌱"
"Leadership isn’t about being irreplaceable—it’s about making yourself replaceable."
"Example: instead of sharing your decisions or opinions, make the effort of explaining your train of thought, and encourage your team to question and critizise on it. When it's their chance, they will be way better equippped to handle spiky situations and adapt to each case. "
""
"5️⃣ Stay Human, Stay Humble 😄"
"Leadership isn’t a superhero gig. Admit when you’re wrong, laugh at your mistakes, and ask for help."
"Confession: I once spent hours “fixing” a bug, only to realize I had been working on the wrong files 🤦"
""
"Your Turn: When has someone stepped aside to let you lead? Or how do you create space for others? Share below—I’d love to hear your stories! 👇"
