"Never make fun of someone who mispronounces a word - it means they learned it by reading.""
""
"I can't find whom to attribute this quote to, but think of this when working with people with a different pronunciation than you. When someone mispronounces something, it is likely not their native language, so they're already on a mental stretch."
""
"Coming from Spain, if you try to speak English you likely get mocked by peers and target of jokes. This is a perfect way to discourage people from trying and getting out of their comfort zone. "
""
"This is also common in other countries where (paradoxically and self-reinforcingly) English is less spoken. I find this especially limiting because speaking English is one of the quickest "hacks" to enhance your professional prospects (either by working abroad or by unlocking better-paying jobs). "
""
"ðŸ™‡ The next time you encounter someone who is not comfortable speaking in English, consider their cultural and societal context: give them a bit of extra comfort, a hand if they miss a word, and a touch of extra kindness."
