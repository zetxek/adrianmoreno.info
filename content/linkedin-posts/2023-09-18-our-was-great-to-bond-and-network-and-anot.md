Our [#hackweek2023](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/hackweek2023) was great to bond, and network ([https://lnkd.in/g86X7DFW)](https://lnkd.in/g86X7DFW)) - and another side effect for me was to reconnect with my craft (as a software engineer)."

"In the world of continuous improvement, there's a powerful principle called "Genchi Genbutsu," which translates to "Go and See." It's not just a concept; it's a mindset that can transform how we approach our work and spot opportunities for improvement."
"In our fast-paced professional lives, getting caught up in the whirlwind of emails, meetings, and deadlines is easy. But to truly excel and drive positive change, we must embrace the craft of what we do - stay connected with the production process."
""
"Enter "Genchi Genbutsu":"
"This concept means getting out of our offices, hitting the factory floor, or immersing ourselves in the customer's shoes. It's about witnessing firsthand how things are done and experiencing the challenges and successes of our processes. For me, in the area of creating digital products - this means staying close to the software engineering."
"This includes the software development tools, language, IDE and code editors - and all the tooling such as translations, testing and continuous integrations processes, or deployments. Staying "fit" enough to be able to use them allows for better understanding of day to day issues, and what could be done better."
""
"When we practice Genchi Genbutsu, we:"
"üïµÔ∏è Spot Hidden Opportunities: By engaging directly with our work, we uncover insights and inefficiencies that might be invisible from a distance."
"üí™ Empower Problem Solvers: It encourages every team member to become a problem solver, driving a culture of continuous improvement."
"üëÇ Build Empathy: Understanding the real-life experiences of our colleagues and customers fosters empathy and drives customer-centric solutions."
"üí° Foster Innovation: Genchi Genbutsu fuels innovation as we gain inspiration from the reality of our work, not just theoretical ideas."
""
"This does not mean to attempt to do all the work. That's why we have teams that can do it more efficiently - but it's a reminder of what matters: the day-to-day decisions taken together with teams have a real impact on the production methods."
""
"So, whether in manufacturing, tech, healthcare, or any other field, remember that practicing your craft‚Äîgetting your hands dirty, so to speak‚Äîcan lead to profound insights and growth opportunities. üå±"
""
"üí° Question: How have you applied Genchi Genbutsu in your work? What opportunities for improvement have you uncovered? Any tip on how to stay close to "the action" while overseeing teams?"
