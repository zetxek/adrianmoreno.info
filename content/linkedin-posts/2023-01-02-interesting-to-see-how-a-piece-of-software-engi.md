Interesting to see how a piece of software engineering jargon like "technical debt" makes it to the mainstream media - and quite a cautionary tale in favour of taking good care of it."
""
"Can't argue with the conclusion (ok, a bit of a spoiler on the article, but no surprise if you had read the news): "Technical debt is real debt. It will eventually be paid by someone"."
""
"A good way to get the feeling of how tech debt disrupts everyday's business is taking a "gemba walk" and getting close to where the action happens. See how long it takes to load information, how cumbersome it is to cross-reference data, or how complicated it is to use the internal systems -- or even better, feel it yourself; and that will lead you to the daily inefficiencies and annoyances that slow down your operations, and slow everything down."
""
"With a new year beginning, it's a good chance to look around with fresh eyes, and instead of "what can I do new", we can also think what we can improve around us."
