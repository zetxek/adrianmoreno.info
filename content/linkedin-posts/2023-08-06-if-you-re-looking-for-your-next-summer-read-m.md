If you're looking for your next summer read - maybe this one catches your eye ðŸ‘€ (if it goes as it went with me)."
""
"Scaling People: Tactics for Management and Company Building, by Claire Hughes Johnson is a fantastic book. I enjoyed reading if from the beginning to the end - and in opposition to many business or strategy books, I found it very insightful."
""
"When I read some of the reference books on how to treat people I feel that I have read a "glorified blogpost", that comes to be "be kind to people". But Claire goes quite some steps ahead, with specific examples and learning opportunities; as well as lightweight processes to prevent these situations as the company scales."
""
"The writing style makes it completely relatable and approachable - and every page is full of really good advice. It touches complicated and complex topics with a light sense of humour, that kept me engaged during the whole book."
""
"If you're looking for inspiration on how to setup internal processes, hiring pipelines, feedback processes or performance evaluations - you might as well take a look to Scaling People."

"Thanks Tobias for the recommendation! ðŸ’¯"
