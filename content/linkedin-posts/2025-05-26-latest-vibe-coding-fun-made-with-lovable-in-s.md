🪄Latest vibe coding fun: [https://lnkd.in/dYrcdK5Q.](https://lnkd.in/dYrcdK5Q.) Made with Lovable in some minutes. "
""
"⌚️ Inspired by the (also vibe coded) app to display QR/barcodes in your Garmin watch ([https://lnkd.in/dwv4bKrp),](https://lnkd.in/dwv4bKrp),) I thought of the possibilities of QR codes that are usually not utilized."
""
"📇 For example, the option to link to a vCard with contact details. It could be a useful way to network at events, which won't include LinkedIn (they use the QR code to link to your profile). It can be a privacy-friendly way to share details, without relying in any online service (once you generate the image, you can save it)."
""
"But overall, it has been a way to have fun and create something (possibly?) useful on the process ✨. If you'd like to know more about the prompt, or anything about the process, drop me a line or a comment! "

"PS: scan the QR in the video - you'll see that it works!"
