Great day of AI talks organized by IDA, in their yearly "Driving AI" event."
"It was really inspiring to see real-world usage of (gen)AI in different environments such as energy trading (Casper Kaae Sønderby from twig.energy), e-commerce recommendations (Mathias Grønne from Roccai), with the combination of more "philosophical" topics like what are agents, or how to orchestrate agents in a multi-agent environment."
""
"The closing speech from Jacob Sherson resonated strongly with me. His concept of "Hybrid intelligence" that puts the human at the center (and controlling seat) of the AI systems feels like the direction we should move towards. Using AI as an amplification of our capabilities, not replacing human decision-making."
""
"I liked a lot the emphasis on the organizational aspect of AI-adoption, as it's rarely a behaviour that is isolated within a company. And especially, the tip to look at AI with the right eye: "create a sense of pride in being an evaluator"."
""
"This strongly aligns with the experience I've been having with generative AI: if you just leave the system in "auto-pilot" the results will be unpredictable, and tend to low quality. If you focus on areas where you have experience and can evaluate - to guide the generation process - that's where you get the best results. A bit like mentoring or coaching a less experienced (but very dedicated) colleague.
