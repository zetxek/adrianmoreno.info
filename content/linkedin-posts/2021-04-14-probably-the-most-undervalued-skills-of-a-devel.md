Probably the most undervalued skills of a developer are communication and empathy."
""
"When you're not capable of understanding who's your audience, there's no way to communicate efficiently (empathy)."
""
"And when you cannot communicate - you work alone in silos and need "interpreters"."
""
"As an industry, during the interviews, we focus so much on the situation that rarely happens: whiteboard programming, diagraming a new greenfield system, extreme race conditions and weird questions."
""
"I'm sure that something we encounter much more often is: "
"- collaborating efficiently with other workers (across the whole company, so also non-technical - and with providers, contractors, other companies, etc)"
"- understanding a legacy project and documentation we got, and extract valuable insights from the stakeholders (again, technical and non-technical), to be able to make relevant changes and improvements to it"
""
"I'm sure that a person with good empathy and communication skills can create the right relationships in the workplace to acquire the knowledge that is needed - without having to be a genius at algorithms, operative systems, or data structures."
""
"Of course, it does help to have the technical foundation - but how about we stop considering these skills "soft" and we rank them as high as the rest?
