If there's something that I HATE (with the capital letters) of "business talk" is referring to people as "resources"."
""
"Already from the time of studying Engineering and Project Management I despised it, because of how lying, misleading and de-humanizing it is: you can exchange resources (bricks, metal, wood, money...) because you know how they compare, interact with each other, etc. But you can't do that with people!"
""
"When exchanging an engineer by another you can't expect the same output. It might be more, it might be less - but a big part of it will be on the interactions of the group of people with each other."
""
"A screwdriver doesn't mind what door is fixing, or a hammer thinks about the kind of nails that would like to hit as next step on their career. You can't ask them either; they're tools, made for a specific task."
""
"If you need more people to participate in a project, please say that you need more colleagues, workers, people, humans, faces - whatever instead of resources. "
"Ask them if they'd like to to contribute to the project, think what's in the project for them, the kind of relationships they'll form. Shape projects in a way where it's also motivating for everyone to join in the task and contribute."
""
"It's more challenging than getting a new saw for the kind of wood to need to cut, but the beauty of working with people is that we adapt and evolve way more too."
