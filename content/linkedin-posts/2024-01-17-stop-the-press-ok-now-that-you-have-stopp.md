STOP THE PRESS 🛑"
"(ok, now that you have stopped: share with your network and get Karma points with me :-)"
""
"I share some cool jobs from SumUp here and there. Today, I bring you THE JOB. You can join not only SumUp (cool) but our team in Copenhagen (double cool) and the Invoices Tribe (triple cool) in Bruno's team."
""
"We are seeking a new colleague to join us as an Android developer for the Accounting squad. With a very well-located office in the center of Copenhagen, daily lunch together, and a chance to influence new product creation. "
""
"We are tackling really interesting problems and working with a lot of greenfield technology in the product we're ramping up, automating expense management. "
""
"While we are part of SumUp (with all the 💪 that it implies), we are about 20 people in the Copenhagen office - which we run as our "small startup" and our "hygge traditions". Best of both worlds! 🇩🇰🌍"
""
"If you have any questions - I'm going to be very biased, but I will be excited to tell you everything about what we are building 🚀. "
