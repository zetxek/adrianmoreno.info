Sunsetting 2024 with some relax… and thankfulness! "
""
"🏖️The end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025 are being quite unique for me - as I’m writing from the beach at 30 degrees, far from the near-freezing temperatures at home."
""
"I am starting 2025 with my parental leave - which is quite unique on its own already, but to add an extra touch, I’m taking my SumUp Sabbatical month (our great Break for me*), and enjoying a paid month off work while I’m traveling with my wife and 9-month old baby in Thailand 😱"
""
"Personally, it will be quite some firsts for me. Otto is our first son, I had never been to Asia, and I had never been off work for longer than 3 weeks or so - so being out for 3+ months will be quite an experience. "
""
"I expect time to bond with Otto, to spend quality time with him, and to build memories together as a family."
""
"Reflecting on this chance - it just fills me with gratefulness for having this opportunity, as it takes a whole team to be able to “disappear” from work for so long with a great peace of mind of knowing that things will be very well taken care of."
""
"I’m actually looking forward to coming back and seeing the progress in my “absent quarter”! 🚀"
""
"*PS: would you like to enjoy this awesome perk of the sabbatical month? Check our positions at [https://lnkd.in/dq4g9xDE](https://lnkd.in/dq4g9xDE) (we currently have one open in our tribe, and keep an eye out for new ones open soon! 🔜). Just mind that other sumuppers will handle your application as I'll be off duty! 🧑‍🧒
