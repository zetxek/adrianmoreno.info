Or how, as an industry, we have perverted "agile" so much that it means "I use Jira and put tickets in sprints", forgetting about the most barebones basics:"

"Working software over comprehensive documentation"
"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"
"Responding to change over following a plan"
""
"(and the correct Jira template!)
