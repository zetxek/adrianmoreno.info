"Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling" - Naval Ravikant ([https://lnkd.in/eMeEx8iD)."](https://lnkd.in/eMeEx8iD).")
""
"The Navalmanack ([https://lnkd.in/eUznewHR)](https://lnkd.in/eUznewHR)) by Eric Jorgenson is a very interesting read that summarizes and puts together some of the disjoint thoughts that N. Ravikant had been sharing on twitter."
""
"It gave a good ratio of "aha moments" and "YES! THAT'S IT!", and some ideas have stuck with me weeks after finishing the book. This one is about the kind of people you surround yourself with, and why it's best to avoid permanently pessimist or cynical people. Being critical is perfectly fine and is needed to improve - but the tiring (and useless) attitude is to always be looking for flaws, for what is wrong - and point mistakes or flaws. "
""
"It's way cheaper to destroy things than to create them. Find people that are able to find flaws, but that are also capable of coming with solutions, workarounds, mitigations and ways to deal with the imperfections of life. "
""
"Next time that you see yourself pointing to a problem without coming to a solution, try to play the game of "what's the worst that can happen". That should help you either finding a solution, or discarding the concern (as not so relevant anyway).
