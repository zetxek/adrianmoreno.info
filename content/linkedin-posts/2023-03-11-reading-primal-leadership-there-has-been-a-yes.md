""
""Research on humor at work reveals that a well-timed joke or playful laugher can stimulate creativity, open lines of communication, enhance a sense of connection and trust, and, of course, make work more fun. Playful joking increases the likelihood of financial concessions during a negotiation. Small wonder that playfulness holds a prominent place in the tool kit of emotionally intelligent leaders.""

"I love to love what I do, and part of it is having fun (poor Anna had to witness it [https://lnkd.in/gNjfYWJW](https://lnkd.in/gNjfYWJW) ðŸ˜†). "
""
"When in a position where people look up to you - it's very helpful to bring a light touch to issues (not all the time, of course). Especially, with some self-deprecating humour on one-self - proving that we know how imperfect we (all) are :-) "
""
