After 1 year and a half my relationship with VanMoof changes: from Tech Lead to Brand Ambassador 🚲 (in other words, I'm leaving the company ;-)"
""
"It has been intense, with funding rounds, new product launches (S3/X3, powerbank), trail-blazing features (Find My network support 🍏)... and a lot of fun on the go. And all this during a worldwide pandemic and an explosion on bike demand 🤯"
""
"I started with a focus on the digital ecosystem, improving the tech foundation (monitoring, infrastructure, SLAs, providers, etc) and boy, we've come a long way. From single instances with scalability and reliability issues to a DevOps culture in AWS, with constant and frequent releases, automated testing, incident reporting and a culture big on growing knowledge and ownership."
""
"The time has gone fast - but I'd like to especially thank the Digital Team for how much fun we've had and how much we've learned together - and even more to everyone I've been lucky to have reporting to me and manage. You've made me realise that I was missing managing people, coaching and being "an enabler"."
""
"What comes next? It's time for big changes! I'll (try to) keep on focusing on the human side on technology in SumUp, in the office in the beautiful Copenhagen 🇩🇰 "
