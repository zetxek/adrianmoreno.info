SumUp's Hackweek 2024 is a wrap - and what a blast it was! ü§©. I'm still absorbing how great this week has been."
""
"Do you know when, as a kid, you're looking forward to the field trip with the class, or the finals with your sports team? That's what the Hackweek feels like at SumUp - both combined."
""
"In this yearly event, SumUp's Engineering, Product, and Design teams (EP&D) get together in a shared location to CREATE as much as possible and collaborate with people you don't usually have the chance with."
""
"In line with our Founder's Mentality value, we self-organize in teams, set a goal (which should cover engineering, product, design, and business plans), and SHIP IT üö¢"
""
"From the incredible Pyramid of Tirana, this year 200+ Sumuppers joined to unleash our creation process. The results were amazing: from innovations that will save us many hours of repetitive processes by applying AI and automation¬†to customer-facing solutions that will bind our products together cohesively, or catalysts on existing initiatives that have been taken to the next level."
""
"And the best¬†part? Many of these projects are either live or almost ready to ship. This success underscores the value of face-to-face communication and the power that self-driven teams, united by a common goal, can achieve. It's the result of our combined collective strength and determination. "
""
"Aside from the hacking itself, meeting so many colleagues in person was invaluable, and spending time having dinner, a drink, or going for an early morning run üèÉ.  Having spent quality in-person time with colleagues makes it so much smoother to later collaborate on projects when we are distributed all over the world üåç"
""
"Can't wait for the next one!
