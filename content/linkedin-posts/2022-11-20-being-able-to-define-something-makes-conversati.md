Being able to define something makes conversations way more engaging and deep than when you're trying to figure out how to call things... ðŸ™Š Let me elaborate on the ideaðŸ’¡ and bring a practical example + a book recommendation (combo!)."
""
"This lies behind the linguistic relativity hypothesis -- that explores if language influences the way that we think. The idea is that having specific words for something makes us faster at processing it."
""
"I find that this comes to practice when working on teams quite often. Having a name, a term, for something - makes it easier to speak about it and have deeper conversations. This is what I find that Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais (Team Topologies) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ helps doing. In the book there is a very good observation on how teams interact, and how they tend to create connections (inner and outside the team boundaries), and how this affects the way of working."
""
"In order to explain the ways that teams work, and explain how different ways of working are better for specific purposes - there is a very useful vocabulary, both as words and also as visual representations. The "automatic" effect that I saw on myself, and others that read the book, is that we can start to think way more in terms of the kind of teams that we work with, and if the ways of working with them are the most appropiate."
""
"The concepts themselves are very digestible and intuitive - with the team types being "stream-aligned", enabling, "complicated sub-system", and platform; and having the following interaction modes between them: collaboration, "x-as-a-service", and facilitating."
""
"I definitely recommend the book - which is very practical and full of examples, and allows reading specific sections (or revisiting), as it's full of visual content. "
"Have you read the book? Did you see a similar effect, on "enriching the conversation"? If not - I hope you do and let me know if you found it useful to have better conversations with your peers!"
