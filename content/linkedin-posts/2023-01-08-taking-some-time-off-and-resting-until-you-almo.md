Taking some time off and resting until you almost get bored is powerful to reconnect with yourself ðŸ¥±"
""
"Last December I enjoyed quite some days off, and made an explicit effort on not hovering around the team work. "
""
"First reason, to not turn myself into a "do as I say, not as I do", and show my teams that it's very much fine and expected to be disconnected from work to fully recharge."
""
"And second - to see where my "inner itch" would take me. Thanks to that I spent some good time investigating the last wave of generative AI (that sounds fancier than "playing with", right?), with Stable Difussion, ChatGPT & company. "
""
"And another "itch" I could cure was to reconnect with some development. Since I have been focusing more on leading teams and managing people I do not have so much time to play with new technologies, update the projects I have, etc."
""
"That was very productive by itself! I took one of my pet projects as the "patient" for my experiments and worked a bit on my website ([https://lnkd.in/dTv6XuT).](https://lnkd.in/dTv6XuT).) Mostly some update tasks on its theme - and that lead to challenging myself with achieving 100% score in Google's Lighthouse web performance score ([https://lnkd.in/eGzyU4m9)"](https://lnkd.in/eGzyU4m9)")
""
"I never knew that Lighthouse showed ðŸŽ†ðŸŽ‡ fireworks when achieving 100%!"
""
"That's no perfect by any means - but that gave me the chance to explore Hugo (the SSG - Static Site Generator - that I use) capabilities for bundling, migrate the hosting of the site to Vercel, exploring (and enjoying!) Checkly a bit more in depth..."
""
"The result? Aside of whatever I ended doing, the best is to come back to work in January with a fresh mind, reconnected with my "doer version" and reminding myself that delegating that facet of work is a choice. "
"And on top of that, some ideas to keep on improving the personal site and host some more content (like a books section ðŸ“š that will present soon!)
