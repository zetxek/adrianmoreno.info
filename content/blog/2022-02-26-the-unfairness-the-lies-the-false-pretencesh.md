The unfairness, the lies, the false pretences.

How can the whole world just look while we let Putin play with Ukraine, a country with more than 44 million of people.And some of them are my dear colleagues.

That I build software with, that I laugh, and share ideas about their dreams, their families.

That are impressing me with their grit - but they should never have to go through this.I can't be proud of the "free world" if we can't even agree on responding in the strongest possible way to such an illegal, lying, and unjust aggression.

How about rejecting to do any business with Russia, and showing that there's no space in the international world for this behaviour?

Cut them off SWIFT, block access to every digital product we create, ban them from any international competition, whatever we can do.

What else does a country have to do to be blacklisted?Let the worst behaviour in others get the best on us, stay strong and united against the bully.
