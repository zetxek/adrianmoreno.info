🧱🏡🧱 LinkedIn is becoming more and more of a walled garden.

While you own the data you post here, LinkedIn makes it quite hard to access it in any way other than browsing their site. That doesn't really scale for automated usage.

On the other hand, they are also known for their fight against scrapers and applications that try to access data from the network in an automated manner... and their APIs are quite lacking (purposefully, as the goal is to keep all data within).

Additionally, the algorithm is punishing all externally published content, leading some people to question LinkedIn as an additional channel for promoting their content on other platforms.

All of these, while I don't have a specific need or use for them, have led me to write (vibe code, one would say) a script to download and use the data in Hugo (the CMS I use for my personal site).
