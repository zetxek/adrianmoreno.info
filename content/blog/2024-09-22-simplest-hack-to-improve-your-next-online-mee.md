🎤 Simplest hack to improve your next online meeting: check (and fix) how you sound to others."Yes, image is a big part of others' perception of us.

But we have mirrors, can see our webcam while in the meeting and can adjust quickly.⏺️ Do yourself a favor: record yourself speaking for some seconds in a tool like https://lnkd.in/dxNfKFAv, check how you sound with different microphones,and choose accordingly.

Test different situations, such as noises in the background, walking around, or being on the go.Don't assume that because you hear others well, the opposite will be true. I would bet that most that read this will have a headset or headphones that are way better at playing audio than recording it (I'm thinking of good consumer-grade headphones, that are not thought or designed for office or transmitting audio).Having others have to second guess what you said or being distracted by background sounds will definitely hurt how what you say is perceived.In the comments I leave some specific tips on hardware that will improve your online presence (spoiler: it doesn't have to be expensive).
