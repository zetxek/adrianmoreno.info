SumUp's Hackweek 2024 is a wrap - and what a blast it was! 🤩. I'm still absorbing how great this week has been.Do you know when, as a kid, you're looking forward to the field trip with the class, or the finals with your sports team?

That's what the Hackweek feels like at SumUp - both combined.In this yearly event, SumUp's Engineering, Product, and Design teams (EP&D) get together in a shared location to CREATE as much as possible and collaborate with people you don't usually have the chance with.In line with our Founder's Mentality value, we self-organize in teams, set a goal (which should cover engineering, product, design, and business plans), and SHIP IT 🚢From the incredible Pyramid of Tirana, this year 200+ Sumuppers joined to unleash our creation process.

The results were amazing: from innovations that will save us many hours of repetitive processes by applying AI and automation to customer-facing solutions that will bind our products together cohesively, or catalysts on existing initiatives that have been taken to the next level.And the best part?

Many of these projects are either live or almost ready to ship.

This success underscores the value of face-to-face communication and the power that self-driven teams, united by a common goal, can achieve.

It's the result of our combined collective strength and determination.

Aside from the hacking itself, meeting so many colleagues in person was invaluable, and spending time having dinner, a drink, or going for an early morning run 🏃.

Having spent quality in-person time with colleagues makes it so much smoother to later collaborate on projects when we are distributed all over the world 🌍Can't wait for the next one!
