Great recap by our David of the results of the work we’ve been putting in the Invoices team.

With a multi-disciplinary angle - not only in the functions involved (design/product/engineering/marketing), but also the smooth collaboration across teams and products.More great things to come, the show is only getting started in sumup invoices !
