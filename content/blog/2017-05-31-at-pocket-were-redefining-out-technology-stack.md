At Pocket we're redefining out technology stack and preparing a future-proof platform.

We come from a LAMP background and we're redoing everything to be more agile, faster, and reliable.Things we are looking into: golang, kubernetes with docker, distributed databases, sysdig, lambda functions, terraform... and whatever we see that can be a good addition to the stack.

We want learners, not know-it-alls, and to have a really flat hierarchy where anyone can participate and grow together with the team.

You'll join a super nice team and company, and enjoy a centric office n Amsterdam.Contact me to know more, and if this is not what you're looking for, tell your friends!
