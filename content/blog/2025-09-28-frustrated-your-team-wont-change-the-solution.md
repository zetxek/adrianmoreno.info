Frustrated your team won't change? The solution starts in the mirror 🪞

We've all been there: you want either to change or start a new behaviour.

Maybe to be more proactive, more collaborative, more curious - you name it. But the change just doesn't stick. It's tried once, and abandoned.

Before you get frustrated, think of this: Are you modelling the behavior you're asking for? Behaviors stick through repetition and are adopted by mimicry, not by command.

Do as I say, not as I do" won't cut it when people look up to you. People don't follow your words; they mirror your actions.

And this isn't just for managers. Leadership is a skill, not a title or position. It's how you show up every day.

Stop telling. Start showing.

Want them in the office more? You be there, present and engaged, not hidden in meetings. Let them see you having those spontaneous, valuable hallway conversations, and you optimize for face-to-face time.

Want them to be more curious? You publicly ask the "dumb" questions. Share an article with a "This made me think..." comment. Show your own learning process.

Want them to support other teams? You be the first to offer help to another department. Celebrate shared wins, not just your team's solo achievements.

Consistent actions set the real blueprint. Your team will match your energy, your commitment, and your priorities—not the ones listed on a slide.

You are the culture. Act like it.
