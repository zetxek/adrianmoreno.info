The update you were expecting: what comes next?

Worksome it is 🎉🚀From the moment I spoke with the team, I felt this was special.

That rare blend of trust, transparency, and infectious energy — where every conversation radiates purpose and values are aligned, with no effort.The funniest thing?

We had spoken years ago - and while the timing wasn't quite right and stayed at SumUp for a bit longer (learning and growing a lot!), I kept an eye on the company trajectory 👀Worksome isn’t just transforming how businesses access global talent; they’re redefining work culture itself.

With their focus on flexibility, inclusion, and lightning-fast compliance, it’s clear why 91% of users love their platform.Having felt the pain of incorporating contingent workers into a company (even when budgets allow!), it feels exciting to help smooth this process and change the way we work.

Beyond excited to contribute to a future where work is truly frictionless and people can spend most of their time doing what they are good at and they love.I had my first day today, and can't hide how awesome it has been. A vibrant office in the heart of the city (won't complain about passing Nyhavn while commuting early - before the tourists take over).

And believe it or not - the flowers made it home! 💐😂Onward! 🙌#FutureOfWork #CompanyCulture #FreelanceRevolution
