I've written a small article on a topic I usually recommend getting deeper into to improve professionally - with the nice side effect of being usable in our daily life too.Funnily enough, it's not something that in an engineering formation is especially emphasized - but it's too powerful of a tool to ignore, or discard because it might make you "weak".

On the other side, it will help you achieve more, in a more effective manner, with happier colleagues, partners and customers.

What do you think, do you have an interest in?
