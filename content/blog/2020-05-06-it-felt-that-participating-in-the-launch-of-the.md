It felt that participating in the launch of the S3 and X3 bikes with VanMoof has been a beautiful step and milestone in my career.

The launch was smooth, we did it under exceptional conditions, and (as much masochistic as it sounds) all the effort and work put the weeks before was worth it!And I wanted to have a memory of this moment - so I've renewed by personal/professional site https://lnkd.in/dTv6XuT. I know the site facelifts tend to last some time, so this image/style will remind me of the new bike launch for a while.During these intense weeks it was also a nice distraction:  I it also to get comfortable with some of the technologies we have used in the website launch, around the AWS stack (Cloudfront, S3, some automations here and there... - although the site is so much simpler and has like 10000 times less traffic :-D)
