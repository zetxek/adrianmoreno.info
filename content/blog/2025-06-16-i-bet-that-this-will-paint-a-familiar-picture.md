I bet that this will paint a familiar picture. A new joiner who thinks everything is wrong but happens to know the perfect tool to solve it. A team that needs to make its mark in a "brownfield" area.

In short: thinking that you can solve system problems by swapping tools, and you end up with the same brokenness, but shinier ✨I am 100% sure that I have been the "new tool prophet" before - but as you get older, you get wiser, I guess.
