We're hiring for a super interesting position, in multiple locations (Copenhagen, Berlin, Varsaw, and also Remote in EU timezone!)We're looking for a software engineer to work in a greenfield project at SumUp, with a very high impact, and a great chance to modernise core systems that will be used by almost everyone of our merchants 🚀We'll be using Kotlin as the platform of choice - but we're happy if you have experience with other JVM languages, and curiosity for it.

There's going to be a great instumentration and observability and focus on quality and engineering excellence.

There will be quite a focus on scalability and performance, also including the database; and a strong collaboration with mobile and web teams to have a UI plugged to it.Of course I'm biased as I'm involved 😜, but it's a great position for somebody looking to make a difference for millions of merchants!Do you know somebody?

Do you want to know more?

Drop me a message!#hiring #kotlin #jvm
