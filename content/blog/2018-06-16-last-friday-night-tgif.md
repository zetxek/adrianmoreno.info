  So, how are Fridays at your company? I believe that at Emakina.NL we know how to make the best of them! #onedayatwork #lastfriday #fridayatemakina. I've written this article on the Saturday morning, because it seemed unreal how much fun I had at the office - not only with my workmates, but with clients, friends and visitors. I want to capture that day to revisit it any moment :-)


  Yesterday it was a pretty cool Friday, with a sprint coming to an end (after two weeks of work), and that involved:



- standup, with many of the teammates from our client that came to the office to join us
- after closing the latest pull requests on the project, and merging and deploying them, we had demo - also with many people from the client joining us (in person and remotely) to give feedback to the latest work and see the latest progress

  As the day was coming to an end, we opened the first beer at the top floor, in the balcony to celebrate the week - and Friday was only continuing! I gave a talk, in one of Emakina's Nerdsummit events, when we share knowledge about some of the technologies or findings we've made. I spoke about Terraform, and other topics we've covered were serverless computing, Virtual Reality, or the ELK stack.

  Over? Oh no! As we have a quite some international crew, we had dinner (pizzas, on the company!) with some drinks (did I mention we have our own tap beer!), and watched together the World Cup match of Portugal vs Spain (what a match, 3-3!).


  And before going home, some gaming night with the Oculus, playing [BeatSaber](http://www.beatsaber.com) (if you have a chance to try it, do it, it's damn fun!)

  *(the shouting on the back were because of an apparently exciting pool game, nobody was hurt during the VR experience - we gave Seth a good security radius 😂)*


  And this weekend I'll be taking our company's boat for a ride, on the Amsterdam canals. Not a bad way to close the week, if you ask me 😁


  Oh - if you've made it until this part of the post... you might be happy to know we're recruiting more people that know to work hard, and also like to have some good fun at work! Contact me to know more!
