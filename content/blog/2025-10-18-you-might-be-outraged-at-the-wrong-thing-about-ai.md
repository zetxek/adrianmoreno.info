🤬You might be outraged at the wrong thing about AI

The problem isn't "AI", in general. The problem, as with most tools, is how we use it.

Too many people treat AI as a peer—an equal collaborator they can blindly trust. This is a catastrophic mistake, and quite quickly leads to losing credibility.

🤔 What have I found that works best for me? Act as a Supervisor.

Treat your AI like a brilliant, hyper-enthusiastic junior intern. It will tirelessly draft, ideate, and execute exactly what it thinks you asked for. But a good supervisor doesn't just delegate and disappear.

You must:

- 📄 Brief it clearly. (Garbage in, garbage out).

- 🧐 Review its work critically. It's a proposal, not a final product.

- 🧑‍⚖️ Add your own expertise and judgment. It lacks your context and conscience.

The output that carries your name is your responsibility. Hiding behind "but an AI wrote it!" is no more acceptable than blaming a junior employee for a public failure. You are the human in the loop, and you are accountable for whatever AI does in your name.

Stop contributing to the sea of AI slop. Elevate your role from spectator to supervisor.
