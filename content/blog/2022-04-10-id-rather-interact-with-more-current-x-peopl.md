I'd rather interact with more "current-X" people than "ex-Y" 🧐Let me extend on this thought.

The space that we have for bios, for introductions and to cause first impressions is limited. I assume that by editing the default "Role at Company" headline that LinkedIn generates, you have put some thought on it.If the best way that you have to show who you are is to highlight that you worked at a specific company - the first impression that I get is a shallow, with a touch of elitism. "I find an implicit message of "I worked at companyX, so I was good", but the way it comes across to me is as a way to try to impress others based on association, instead on qualities or credentials. I care more of who you are, what you learned and how you treat others than were you studied or worked before. I hope that there's something else that can define you than were you worked before.And past successes don't grant future ones, so you better be adaptable and not be defined by the past!Signed:"Adrián Moreno Peña, ex-traordinary dad joke maker, ex-cellent colleague and sometimes ex-aggerating writer, for the purpose of making my rants more enterntaining
