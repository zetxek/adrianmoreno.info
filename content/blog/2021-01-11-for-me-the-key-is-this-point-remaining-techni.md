For me the key is this point: "Remaining technical away from the critical pathI could contribute on many of the parallel lines of development we have at the same time active in VanMoof - and I could easily and quickly become the bottleneck of delivery.So I prefer to take a "back seat" approach, let my developers do the "heavy lifting" that requires hours of deep focus, and work with them on facilitating, removing impediments, and contributing here and there in non-expected, non-critical bugs.That way I keep the feeling of the development experience that I aim to constantly improve (tooling, automations, etc), and I don't become blocking in any team effort.
