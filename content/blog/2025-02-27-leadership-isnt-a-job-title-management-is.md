Leadership isn’t a job title. Management is. 🧭"
"
"Let’s clear something up: Leadership and management get mixed around like synonyms, but they’re different concepts. Sometimes they overlap, but they're not the same."
"
"Here’s the thing:"
"✅ Anyone can lead – Influence, inspire, take ownership. That’s leadership."
"✅ Managers manage – Hire, budget, execute. That’s a specific job."
"
"But here’s the trap: When we act like “leadership” is code for “managers only,” we tell the rest of the team: “Your voice doesn’t matter; leave this to us.”"
"Worse? We end up with managers who manage processes but don’t lead people. And teams waiting for permission instead of stepping up."
"
"📚 A book that puts this greatly is "Turn the ship around!", by L. David Marquet. A submarine captain flipped the script on the traditional “leader-follower” model—where only the person at the top “leads”—and instead built a “leader-leader” culture. His secret? Leadership wasn’t about authority. It was about empowering everyone to make decisions, regardless of rank. The result? A crew that didn’t just follow orders… they owned outcomes."
"
"Next time you hear, "I would like a leadership position, but I have no team to manage 🙁" remember this vital difference and encourage anyone to lead from wherever they are. "
"
"Leadership isn’t reserved or limited. It should be spread and encouraged to grow anywhere in your teams 💪. As leaders, we must make sure that everyone at the "edges of the organization" has the right context to keep alignment with the shared goals and mission, and information to decide by themselves."
