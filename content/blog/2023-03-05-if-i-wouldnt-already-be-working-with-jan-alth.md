If I wouldn't already be working with Jan (although from another team), I would apply right away!

High impact, super interesting service, great team - and a really interesting tech landscape.

And you can't not love a job description that asks you to "Have a good sense of humor about yourself and your work" - that's the place I love to work at :-)#job #devops #productionengineering
