Better, more honest and useful ads will respond.

And this innovation didn't come from Goog or FB - but from the competitors that need to challenge them...In five years, when the next cycle of ad tech is in blossom, we will look back at this moment and wonder what we were thinking.

Remember when 12% of all time spent on the internet was on Yahoo?

That was 2007, just ten years ago.

Today, it's hard to see past the dominance of Facebook and Google as publishers, or to see past the terrible condition of media companies on the open web.
