Edited✍️ - as this is not "coming soon", but you can get the full podcast below :-)https://lnkd.in/e9zG8g6yI hope that I brought some interesting insights on the leadership principles we apply at SumUp, very rooted in discipline - and how we balance autonomy and self-drive with this.As mentioned during the podcast, the SumUp Wildly Transformational Fundamentals (WTF) Handbook is quite a gold nugget: https://lnkd.in/e-8etRrKIf there's anything that you'd like me to explain in more detail - I'll be happy to to do so!
