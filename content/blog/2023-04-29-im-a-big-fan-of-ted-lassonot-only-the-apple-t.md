I'm a big fan of Ted Lasso.

Not only the Apple TV+ comedy series about an American football coach who becomes the manager of a struggling English soccer team - but also Ted Lasso as a fictional leader.If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it.

Not only because it's hilarious and heartwarming, but also because it offers some valuable leadership lessons that can be applied to any team or organization.Here are some of the things I learned from Ted Lasso and we can all try to apply in our teams:- Be optimistic and positive.

Ted Lasso is always cheerful and upbeat, even when things are going wrong.

He never gives up or loses hope, and he inspires his team to do the same.

He believes in the power of positivity and kindness to overcome any challenge."- Be curious and open-minded.

Ted Lasso is not afraid to admit what he doesn't know, and he's always eager to learn from others.

He listens to different perspectives and opinions, and he respects different cultures and backgrounds.

He embraces diversity and inclusion as a source of strength and creativity."- Be empathetic and compassionate.

Ted cares deeply about his players and staff, and he shows it in many ways.

He remembers their names and personal details, he asks them how they are doing, he supports them when they are struggling, and he celebrates their successes.

He treats everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their role or status."- Be humble and authentic.

He doesn't pretend to be someone he's not, and he doesn't let his ego get in the way of his mission.

He acknowledges his mistakes and apologizes when he's wrong.

He's honest and transparent with his team and his boss, and he expects the same from them."- Be vulnerable and trusting.

Ted goes through quite some personal challenges, including dealing with anxiety and situations that he's not sure how to navigate.

He trusts his closest team with this, and prioritizes his family when possible to focus on what matters to him."- Be flexible and adaptable.

He's willing to experiment and try new things, even if they seem unconventional or risky.

He's not afraid to change his plans or strategies when the situation requires it.

He's always looking for ways to improve himself and his team, and he welcomes feedback and suggestions.Not only the show is entertaining and full of puns - but it has also helped me reflect on leadership styles, and how being comfortable on your own skin is so important to be authentic and inspire others.
