This is why you cannot have a team of only super stars - you end in an ego-fight, a self-driven escalation where the team and personal objectives drift apart.Somebody needs to be willing to do the dirty work and "take one for the team"!As a manager it's important to acknowledge and recognise the performers that keep a team together.

They might not have the brightest stats, the greatest achievements and stories to tell - but they're the concrete that holds the house together.
