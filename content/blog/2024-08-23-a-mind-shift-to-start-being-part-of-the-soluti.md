💡A mind shift to start being part of the solution, instead of tolerating broken things: replace "it's not my job" with "let's find out how to solve this".🪟The broken windows theory states that visible signs of crime or antisocial behavior encourage further crimes - leading to an escalation in violence.

The same thing can happen in a workplace when small things are observed that do not work as they should, and no one does anything to fix or prevent them.Of course, you won't be able to fix everything yourself.

There will be problems with a larger scope, areas where you don't know the responsible people or any other reason.

But any small steps compound others' behavior and signal that "we care" to the rest of the group: start with a smaller iteration, find the responsible person, and let them know - take some action.Think of that the next time you find something not working as it should—whether it's a full dishwasher that needs to be emptied, the registration form for your landing page, or a customer who got a less-than-ideal experience.✨ Small gestures can also show that you care and induce a positive cascade.
