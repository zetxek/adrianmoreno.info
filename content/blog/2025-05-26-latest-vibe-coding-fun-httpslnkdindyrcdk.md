🪄Latest vibe coding fun: https://lnkd.in/dYrcdK5Q.

Made with Lovable in some minutes. ⌚️ Inspired by the (also vibe coded) app to display QR/barcodes in your Garmin watch (https://lnkd.in/dwv4bKrp), I thought of the possibilities of QR codes that are usually not utilized.📇 For example, the option to link to a vCard with contact details.

It could be a useful way to network at events, which won't include LinkedIn (they use the QR code to link to your profile).

It can be a privacy-friendly way to share details, without relying in any online service (once you generate the image, you can save it).But overall, it has been a way to have fun and create something (possibly?) useful on the process ✨.

If you'd like to know more about the prompt, or anything about the process, drop me a line or a comment! PS: scan the QR in the video - you'll see that it works!#vibecoding #lovable #aiassistedprogramming
