The first follower is an underestimated form of leadershipDon't get the wrong idea that to lead others you need to be the one that has to always make the first move.

Support others.

Join an early good idea that needs some nurturing.

Be the first one getting excited and evangelize about it.And if you're trying to get something moving - go get that first follower, and get your movement started!#leadership
