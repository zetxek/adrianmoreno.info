I've been thinking a bit lately about setting and aligning incentives.

It's quite a journey - and it can be both the path to success by aligning every gear around you, or the path to a very hard time.

As Ramez Naam put it:If your incentives are set up wrong - if for some reason you reward people for behavior that's actually bad for your customers or your organization - then you're going to encourage that behavior.What are your thoughts on the topic?

Any specific method you like to apply?
