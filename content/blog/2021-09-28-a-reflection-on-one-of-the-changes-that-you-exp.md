A reflection on one of the changes that you experience as you become a manager or a leader...I can't just be more humbled and driven by pursuing a career in technology leadership than when I read the comments and feedback that my colleagues and people that I managed give me - and they explain how I had a positive impact in their jobs and careers.

The transition from Individual Contributor to a "leader" forces you to look at your impact from a "multiplier" point of view, as your success is reflected on your peers' successes.The feedback loop is longer - as your actions take longer to reflect on others - but you know that you can enjoy leading others when you get as happy (or happier!) when the ones around you are successful too.

That should be your main driver, the rest follows.
