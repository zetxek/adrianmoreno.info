🚨 Two months in at Worksome, first job alert 🎉Time flies (when you're having fun), and it's about to be two months here. I'm (especially) excited as we have the first job opening in my team, working directly with the great Lucas & his team, to work from the (greatly located office) in Copenhagen.We have a strong focus on the Laravel ecosystem (and Vue in the frontend), but the most important aspect is that we are a truly flat team, where engineering has a significant say in how we build our product.

That makes the job ideal for someone who wants to develop a digital product and solve customer problems (using technology, of course). " "If you have someone in mind, feel free to put us in contact! "https://lnkd.in/dty7UQtU
