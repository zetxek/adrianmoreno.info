Knowing how to program for iOS makes programming for OS X (Cocoa) easier, but it's not inmediate.

Many things you take for granted because they exist on the mobile platform don't have a direct counterpart on iOS, or they are not as mature...But anyway, creating a very simple OS X app with Carolina Barreiro is being interesting to try new things.

The app is a simple Kodi/XBMC remote written in swift... and some improvements will come, specially in the design :-)
