Do you know that kind of online profile that only gives bad reviews, and complains about everything?

Bad service, bad food, bad stay, bad experiences everywhere.

It's not me, it's the world".I find that to be credible and trustworthy when giving feedback, you need to "see everything", the good and the bad parts.

You need to build that trust by showing that you care for the person, and genuinely want to help them by providing it.When the only feedback that you give is "corrective" (aka negative), you're giving a similar vibe to the person.

It costs NOTHING to recognize good work in others, and it's important to not take it for granted.Did somebody give a good presentation?

Do they make you feel very welcome at work?

Do you get good energy from them when you're in the same meeting?

Do you like how well they prepare documentation for their projects?

Anything?

Tell them!Next time, when you find something they could do better, you will have a bit more credibility on your constructive criticism, and that you not only see the "bad parts", but also see what they do well, and you aim to improve their work.#feedback #recognition
