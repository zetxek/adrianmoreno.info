Proud to contribute to this cause and for the ones that have driven the initiative at SumUp and how it represents us 👏🏼From outside you would think "at a company of this scale, it must be so difficult to get green light for something like this" - but all it takes is a "stubborn" group of individuals that believe in the cause, apply the "founder's mentality" value that drives the company... and gets it done!Trying to do the right thing at such a scale is something worth fighting for! 🌏 #sustainability #givingback
