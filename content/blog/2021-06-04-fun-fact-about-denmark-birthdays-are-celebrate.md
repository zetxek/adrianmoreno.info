Fun fact about Denmark: birthdays are celebrated with (lots of) flags.

The danish flag (Dannebrog) has a double function as “birthday flag” to celebrate any big ocassion (like my first birthday in the country 🥳🇩🇰)2nd fun fact (yeah, I'm generous as it's my birthday): it's the flag with the world record of being the oldest continuously used national flag.This is how my desk looked when I left it unattended for a bit at SumUp today 🇩🇰🇩🇰🇩🇰🎊🎊🍾 (in the Copenhagen office of course :-D)Tak, mine kolleger!
