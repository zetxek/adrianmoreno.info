In order to protect the team, you have to go against the real interests of your customers.

You simply can't be in the same boat with them.I have seen this happening too many times.

In order to make a living in software consultancy services you don't want to go for the most productive solution, but for the most billable one.

As I see it, if you are doing consultancy you need to charge based on the provided value, not the time spent on the project, and go for clients that will understand the value you will deliver.
