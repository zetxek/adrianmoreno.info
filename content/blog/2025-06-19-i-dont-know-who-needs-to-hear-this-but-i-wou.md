I don't know who needs to hear this - but I would, many times in my career: Stop Trying to "Fit In" at work.

And anywhere else.Your Weirdness is your trait.They’ll hand you scripts, in the form of feedback or advice:"- “Say this.”"- “Present like that.”"- “Copy their tone.”"🔥Burn the manual.🪨 Feedback isn’t gospel—it’s raw material that you should process.Appreciate every feedback, but filter it smartly.

Nobody knows you better than yourself: "🤺Take what sharpens your edge."🙉 Ignore what dulls your fire.Never let someone else’s "should" overwrite your can.Your quirks?"That chaotic laugh.

Your weird sense of humor.

Your crowded diagrams.Weaponize them.Why?Plastic clones crack under pressure."Authenticity scales and is remembered.Your voice—not an echo—is what cuts through noise and what sticks."You weren’t hired to be a copy-paste."You were hired to be the main character of your role."If they don't like the full version of yourself, find a better place that appreciates you wholly.#careeradvice #beyourself
