I bring a new book recommendation, especially for technologists - or anyone who has found themselves not "winning" a conversation where they thought they had all the facts right and aligned.Rory Sutherland's "Alchemy: The Surprising Power of Ideas That Don't Make Sense" book is an excellent reminder that originality and the unexpected have a lot of value, because that's how we think and make decisions.With the surge of AI and how easy it makes it to regurgitate (or invent) data, this will even be more important #bookrecommendation #alchemy #decision
