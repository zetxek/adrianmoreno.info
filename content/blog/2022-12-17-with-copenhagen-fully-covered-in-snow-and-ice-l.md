With Copenhagen fully covered in snow and ice like a Christmas Wonderland - it made me reflect on how lucky we are to be able to see the whole 4 seasons changing from the office at SumUp in Copenhagen ☃️🍂🌞🌱I really appreciate having a place to go to work that is inspiring, and encourages you to take walking meetings around the lakes, or just enjoy the views together during lunch in the warm days.

While I find that working in a distributed manner is fine for many cases - there’s nothin like the magic of getting together around a table, sharing a screen or a whiteboard and being able to read the body language of the people we work with.

For that - having an inspiring and welcoming place to gather is so important; in my eyes in the “remote/hybrid/in-person” debate - the offices should really position as an attractive option.On top of the views there are other ways that we try to make it attractive to come and meet here, like our weekly breakfast or seasonal events (like sharing gløgg and æbleskiver in Christmas).

That way coming to the office is not done because we have do, but because we want to.From the gray, only functional place that you would take as a workplace - to a nice, engaging location where people go because they want to and prefer, not only because they’re forced to.How are the views from your office?

Maybe you have inspiring interiors that encourage people to get together?

Or a beautiful commute?#officeviews #workplaceculture #sumup
