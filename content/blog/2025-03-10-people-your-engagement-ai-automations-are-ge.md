People, your "engagement AI automations" are getting out of hand.

It's not "increasing engagement and visibility" of your brand, but giving a shit first impression.As with anything computer-generated, you need to supervise what these random tools do in your behalf, such as:🤦‍♂️ useless comments: "What a great summary of news, thanks for sharing".

Cool AI - that's what reactions are for"😵‍💫 completely out of context comments: (in a piece of news) "Please <Name> connect with me and we can discuss the background of the position". WHAT POSITION!?"🙉 repetitive content: it seems that your AI has "read" the post, but not the other 50 useless comments (see point one), and yours has become a REPETITIVE PIECE OF CRAP.I still believe that AI can generate much value, automating repetitive tasks and augmenting human cognition.

But putting an AI to drive your LinkedIn persona in autopilot seems like a very quick way to ruin your personal brand 🗑️#enshittification #autopilotai #nobodydriving
