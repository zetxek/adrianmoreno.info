A very interesting article by Segment about dual leadership that an Engineering Manager and a Product Manager have in a product teamSince my first day - my biggest ally and "sparring partner" has been Hannah.

From her I get the "Why" of what we are building, so I can work with the development team on "how" and "what" we are going to build.I know I can trust Hannah on the roadmap and supporting me when we need to make difficult decisions (what to prioritize, delay features in favour of tackling technical debt...), if we're on the same page.

And that way the team can be sure that what we are building matters.Does it sound interesting?

We're hiring fullstack developers in Kyiv or Copenhagen! ;-)#hiring #engineering #leadership #productdevelopment #copenhagen #kyiv
