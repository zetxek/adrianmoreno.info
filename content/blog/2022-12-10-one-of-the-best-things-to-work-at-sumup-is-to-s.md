One of the best things to work at SumUp is to see how our work directly helps small merchants run their businesses.

It is great to be in contact with our merchants, understanding them and learning from their entrepreneurial stories.We do that in multiple ways: by talking to merchants on their businesses, feedback that is provided to us to improve our products - or interviews where we can dive deeper into how they use our technology, what they like about it and what we can do better.In the photo you can see the team in our Invoices tribe paying lots of attention to one of our merchant interview sessions, greatly lead by Neža being "our voice" with the merchant.

This was one of the initiatives run in our tribe by our colleague Anton (Engineering Manager in one of our squads) to get inspiration from our merchants, and have an extra push of motivation to deliver a great experience to them ♥️Sessions like this are not only insightful - but they're also a direct application of our mission: "A world where small businesses can be successful doing what they love" -- and our values, helping us to connect with them at a deeper level and reinforce the care for what we do.#userinterviews #teambonding #companyvalues
