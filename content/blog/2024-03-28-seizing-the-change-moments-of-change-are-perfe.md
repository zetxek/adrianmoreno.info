Seizing the change: moments of change are perfect for creating new habits (or reinforcing them) 💡We just moved our offices in Copenhagen at SumUp, which has created a perfect opportunity for me to try new habits.

One thing I have tried recently is changing my commute: instead of cycling straight to work, I take the race bike and add some extra kilometers, or I run to the office.The new office location next to Vesterport is very good for this... but so was the previous one too 😅.

Sometimes, all it takes to try something you want is to shake your routine and give it a try.💡 Maybe with the time changing this Sunday you can try to link that change to trying something you wanted to do... (waking up earlier to exercise, meditating routinely, taking a walk after each lunch...)
