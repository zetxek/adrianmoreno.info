This year I culminated a process in which I have invested more than at many of the jobs or education I've had. A journey of stubbornness and self-believe that has led me to complete my first Ironman triathlon, enduring with training during the weird pandemic months - just because I really wanted to finish the process I started.Why?

Maybe just to prove that I'm capable of it to myself, who knows 🤷‍♂️ "But I've definitely taken many learnings that I carry with me for any ambit of my life, including the professional one (that is the one that matters for Linkedin, right? 😅) #ironman #triathlon #endurancetraining #perseverance
