#hackweek2023 - that's a wrap!For one full week, the members of the Engineering, Product and Design teams of SumUp gathered together again, in person, to experiment and create together.🇧🇬 This year we met in Bulgaria (where we have a great office in Sofia), next to the Black Sea.
For five full days, the sole goal of the week is to self-organize in problems we want to solve, iterate - and even ship it to production!

🚀"🎯 It's a great reminder of what we are capable of achieving with razor-sharp focus.The team I worked with had the fantastic Alex, Bruna and Justinas - all of us from different locations (London, São Paulo, Vilnius, and Copenhagen) and teams.

We created a tool to improve the Payment Reminders that SumUp Invoices generates, making them smart - by applying AI to a real-world problem, aiming to make our merchants' work easier. "🥳And had a lot of fun while doing so!And that's also what it's about: getting some quality time together, meeting colleagues in person - and bonding. I'm sure that the effects of this week will last over years, because it's always easier to interact online when you have met in person before.Looking forward to what we will create next after this reinvigorating week!
