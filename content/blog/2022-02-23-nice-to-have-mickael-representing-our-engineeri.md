Nice to have Mickael representing our Engineering team in the podcast about leading tech teams with other leaders from Copenhagen 🇩🇰Also so happy to see that Mickael really impersonated some of the value that are expected from the leaders at SumUp (https://lnkd.in/gsxt7Byx).

At the heart of the company are our teams, and they need to be lead with humility and really putting ourselves at the service of our colleagues to help them.

Well said Mickael! (and if you want to know some more fun facts... listen to the pod! )For more team-building and aiming to continue creating full fledged solutions for the merchants of the world to grow their businesses! 🌎
