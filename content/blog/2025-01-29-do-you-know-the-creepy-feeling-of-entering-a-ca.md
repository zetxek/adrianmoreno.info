Do you know the creepy feeling of entering a calm shop to look around and feeling stalked by the shop "assistants"?

It ends up making you leave the shop uncomfortable instead of checking the goods.That's what cold (tactless) "outreach" in Linkedin feels like.

Not even a "hi", let's just make a connection so you can slide into my DMs without spending an InMail credit 🙈I hope Linkedin would allow us to get a captcha to send a connection from ${vendor.first_name}
