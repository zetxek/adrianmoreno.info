Would you like to elevate the quality of your work? ✨"Try one "trick": act as if the work that you are doing could become public at any given time in the future.Your mails or slack messages get published, your code made open source, or a colleague writes a book about how you're involved in a project you work together.

How would you feel about it?

If the answer is not "proud" - think about what you can do better, because clearly you already know you can do better.
