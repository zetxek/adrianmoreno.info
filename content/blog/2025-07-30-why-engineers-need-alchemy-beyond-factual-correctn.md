# [🦄 Why Engineers Need "Alchemy": Beyond Factual Correctness to Human Magic](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-engineers-need-alchemy-beyond-factual-correctness-moreno-pe%C3%B1a-m1yef)




After [recommending "Thinking, Fast and Slow"](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adrianmoreno_i-have-a-very-dense-book-recommendation-activity-7308919117636395008-lz9y?rcm=ACoAAAGHsQQBBfaHe4aRgGlUlu4ZSc33Vl_E9nQ), I bring today another book recommendation that should be on the list for all technologists: [**Rory Sutherland**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?nis=true#)'s "Alchemy". I especially enjoyed reading it after Kahneman's book, to add a bit of color to the "cognitive biases" more as to what they are: how we think and make decisions. "

Here’s why these two books are secret weapons for technologists who want to spark passion, and not only "convince with data":

### 🔥 The Core Tension: Kahneman’s Systems vs. Sutherland’s "Psycho-Logic"

- **Kahneman** maps how we decide: System 1 (intuitive, emotional) and System 2 (logical, deliberate). Engineers adore System 2—it feels safe, optimized, "correct."
- **Sutherland** rebels: "Logic is a rear-view mirror". He argues **System 1 drives 90% of decisions**, yet we design products/processes for System 2. Result? "**Factually perfect but emotionally sterile" interactions that disengage users—and teams**.
*🧑🦯 Engineer’s blind spot: We solve for efficiency, not for the human experience of the solution.*

### ⚗️ 3 "Alchemical" Rules Every Tech Team Should Steal

**1. "The Opposite of a Good Idea Can Also Be a Good Idea"**

- Example: Red Bull succeeded because it tasted awful + was overpriced—signalling "extreme energy," not just "beverage."
- 🐞* For engineers: Sometimes a "flaw" (e.g., slower load time for suspense) creates delight. Not every bug needs fixing.*
**2. "Don’t Design for Average"**

- Extreme users reveal more than the "rational" middle. Example: The sandwich was invented for a gambler who refused to leave cards for a meal.
- *⇲ For engineers: Personas are dead. Obsess over edge cases—they’re innovation gold, and averages are a deadly boring and mediocre ground to be placed.*
**3. "A Flower Is Simply a Weed with an Advertising Budget"**

- Perception > reality. Example: Stripe toothpaste cleans no better—but stripes signal "advanced science" to our brains.
- *🪄For engineers: Data without storytelling is noise. Wrap logic in magic.*

### 🚫 The Cost of Ignoring "Alchemy" in Tech

- **Disengagement**: Users tolerate "logical" UX but love "irrational" ones (e.g., Duolingo’s absurd notifications).
- **Team friction**: Engineers who dismiss "soft" factors create solutions that are precisely wrong vs. vaguely right.
- **Innovation stagnation:** As Sutherland warns: "Logic kills magic". Blockbuster died optimizing DVD logistics while Netflix sold nostalgia-in-a-red-envelope ✨.

## 💥 Become a "Psycho-Logical" Engineer

1. **Test the "irrational"**: Add whimsy to a feature (e.g., [**Slack**](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/?nis=true#) /shrug). Measure and optimize for emotional response, not just KPIs.
2. **Reward "alchemy" in code reviews**: Celebrate solutions that are human-elegant, not just machine-efficient.
3. **Study Kahneman + Sutherland as a duo**: One gives you the map; the other hands you a machete to blaze new trails and be more impactful.
