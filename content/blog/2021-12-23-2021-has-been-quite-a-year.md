2021 has been... quite a year 🤪

Neck down in the not-so-ending pandemic, surfing through covid variants, country lockdowns and all the uncertainties that this brings (will I be able to travel? To take holidays? To go to a concert?), and all the doubts of being in a situation that we had not been before.

Luckily in tech we've been able to adapt quite quickly and efficiently to this new "work from home" as default - but that has come with quite a toll on how we interact with each other, the boundaries between work and time off, and the possibility of disconnecting from work.

I'm quite happy that at SumUp we're having a company-wide time off during this festive week ahead, between Christmas Eve and New Years.

I definitely look forward to getting off the screen a bit, and go for a walk in the forest, enjoy the fresh crisp winter air on a bike ride, or just enjoying the "dolce fare niente" for a bit to come back with recharged batteries 🔋

And you, wow are you doing to make sure that you start the year full or energy? ⚡️
