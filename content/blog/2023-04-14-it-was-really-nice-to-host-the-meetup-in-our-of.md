It was really nice to host the meetup in our office in Copenhagen 🇩🇰.

Great talks, both the organized ones and the informal.Meetups are great for networking, learning how others are tackling similar challenges, and why not - also share back learnings!As our colleague Jonathan M.

Hethey did, sharing some good learnings after working with our open source design system (https://lnkd.in/eEMNXyEF).Thanks to everyone that came - looking forward to hosting more sessions and share some of our experiences!
