Hey Amsterdam network ❌❌❌I think this is a super cool position! (OK I'm biased because I _was doing_ the job until some weeks ago, when I became evangelizer 🚲 🤣)But VanMoof is in a super interesting moment + great team (OK biased here too, they were my lovely team) + super interesting ecosystem around a great product (what's not to love about these ebikes?).

It's a great position for person with a mix of hands-on and managerial experience, to focus more on the team management (while staying close to tech).If you want to know more about the role and how it was day to day, I can help #amsterdam #engineeringmanagers 👀
