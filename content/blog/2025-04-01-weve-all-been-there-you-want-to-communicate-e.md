We've all been there: you want to communicate effectively and use some obvious and harmless acronyms.

Or that's what you thought...The bad news?

It's not only not effective but it might hurt communication.When someone doesn't inmediately get your acronym, any keystrokes you saved are instantly outweighed by:"• Explanation time"• Potential misunderstandings"• Execution errorsAnd the wider the audience and scope of your communication, the more likely this is to happen.

Acronyms that are obvious for one team get lost in translation as the range of collaboration expands.The real hack?

Text expansion tools.For example: I type "BE" and my system expands it to "Backend" automatically.

This gives me typing efficiency without sacrificing clarity for my team.💡Try TextExpander or your device's built-in text replacement settings (if you're using Mac or iOS you have it available in your device settings)
