Remember to tell your colleagues that you appreciate them.

Don't take it for granted, don't take those things you like of them as "normal".You might make somebody blush for a moment, but there's nothing like knowing that your colleagues appreciate those small things you do, and others would take for granted!#appreciation #positiveworkenvironment
