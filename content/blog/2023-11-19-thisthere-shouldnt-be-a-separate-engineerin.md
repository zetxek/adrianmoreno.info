This."There shouldn't be a separate "engineering roadmap" to start with.

Same as "product roadmap", "marketing roadmap", or "design roadmap".(get your Freddy Mercury karaoke vibe and mentally repeat) One team, one vision - one roadmap, no division 🎸The capacity of the team should be looked at as a holistic system, and the leaders should align on how to use the capacity across all teams best.

What's the point of having a "product roadmap" that leads to invisible technical debt being introduced, that will slow down your team as tangled ropes on your team wheels?Or a technical roadmap that will not deliver any short or long term value to customers.Have the difficult conversations with your peers, and figure what's the most valuable path forward - together.
