Excellent tips for tech job seekers from Will.

This is the way I'd recommend approaching both looking for a job and keeping an eye on the market.

I'd add a few more tips:

1. Keep an eye on local-specific sites or portals - such as The Hub for the Nordics.

2. Leverage the local meetups as well (many of the companies sponsoring them are usually hiring, as it's part of the employer branding).

3. Make sure to get feedback on your CV/applications.

If you are on the job hunt right now, as you have probably noticed, the market is weird, so don't give up! Set up a system and persevere.
