Do you know that feeling that you get sometimes when you start chatting with a group and you instantly click with them? ✨What a delight of a chat I had with Olga, Juan and Harri.

Thanks Christopher for "selecting" us and getting us to talk about something that we all so deeply care about: how to best serve our teams, so we can be more productive and efficient in the organization.I think we touched some good points about how we can better help our teams on this mission - I hope it's as nice to listen as it was to participate 🎤PS: if you're not familiar with Christopher's podcast - get on it.

He has super interesting guests and topics (I'm not biased at all because I've been invited, of course 😉)#engineeringmanager #coaching #leadership
