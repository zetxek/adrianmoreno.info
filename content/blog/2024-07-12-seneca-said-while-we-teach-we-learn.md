Seneca said, "While we teach, we learn".

It was energising to share some of the learnings with my peers at SumUp, and participate in the impactful global leadership program as a facilitator. Together, we make each other so much better.

Teaching something to an audience is such a humbling experience. You discover your own knowledge and skills gaps, which forces you to digest the content at a much deeper level. And the moment that the "students" share their insights or questions, you return to the learning seat.

Thanks for organizing Débora, Gabriel, Chinyere, Natalie, Jennifer - and Joanna for sharing the stage - it was a blast! 💥
