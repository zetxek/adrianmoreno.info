Reading Primal Leadership there has been a "yes that's it!!" moment - something that resonated strongly with my experience:Research on humor at work reveals that a well-timed joke or playful laugher can stimulate creativity, open lines of communication, enhance a sense of connection and trust, and, of course, make work more fun.

Playful joking increases the likelihood of financial concessions during a negotiation.

Small wonder that playfulness holds a prominent place in the tool kit of emotionally intelligent leaders.I love to love what I do, and part of it is having fun (poor Anna had to witness it https://lnkd.in/gNjfYWJW 😆).

When in a position where people look up to you - it's very helpful to bring a light touch to issues (not all the time, of course).

Especially, with some self-deprecating humour on one-self - proving that we know how imperfect we (all) are :-) The book is written by Daniel Goleman, Richard Boyatzis and Annie McKee - and although I have not finished it yet, I'd recommend it so far.
