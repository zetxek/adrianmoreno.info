It's nice when you still feel proud about your contribution in the previous job, and happy for the great colleagues you left behind.What a launch that was in the tech side also.

The months of migrating infrastructure, updating software, load testing, collaboration with Resn in the design and experience... all for that smooth launch event where all came together 🚀Go VanMoof!
