🥲 Today is a weird day for me, as it is my last day at SumUp.

This has been my longest ride ever - 4+ years.

That says it all. I joined thinking, "Could I enjoy a larger company...?

This one looks like it could work..." and ended with my longest tenure. I came with curiosity about fintech and how a company could make money from card payments - leave wiser (also with more gray hair, one must confess) - things like card exchanges, regulated products, and international launches feel natural now 🌍Looking back, I am extremely grateful.⚡️ For every leader who saw sparks in me before I did and gave me a chance."🌱 For every sumupper who shared feedback with me or found my input useful for their personal growth."🚀 For every teammate who turned chaos into "holy shit, we shipped that.📣 For everyone who bore with my (endless) questions during incidents ("should we update the status page?!")"🕴 For every merchant I’ve ambushed with "Psst… what fees are you paying?" (#ICanOfferABetterCardReader forever  ).SumUp has been a place where I truly felt I belonged and has exceeded my expectations of what I could achieve, thanks to the enabling culture embedded in our values. I have grown a lot here!The exciting part is that a new chapter is about to start.

Closer to home 🇩🇰, less planes, more playgrounds: more time to spend at home with the Chaos Commander Otto (1y+ of experience in the role) and my superstar wife Line - stay tuned!! 🦄Thank you for everything, SumUp! 🙏
