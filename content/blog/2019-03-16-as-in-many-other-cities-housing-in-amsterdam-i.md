As in many other cities, housing in Amsterdam is in a complicated situation - with a city that is very interesting to live in and people moving, it puts pressure on the housing market.

As internationals, we're attracted to work and live here - and yet we're blamed because of the rise in prices and scarcity.

As I find that unfair, because it overlooks how much we deliver to the society with our knowledge and work, enabling so many local companies to go global business, I spoke with the local tv AT5 to give my vision on the topic.And if you want to join follow the steps of "Expat Adrián", at Emakina.NL we're hiring in many positions!

Tech, SEO, Project Managers... give me a message and I'll help you find a place to live, as we the Expats control the market 😂
