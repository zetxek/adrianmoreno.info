Really looking forward to this! 🥳In a world of working through online tools - I especially enjoy the moment of complicity of working on something together sharing a desk.

Organic conversations without having to raise a hand or check who was next at the queue - only to get a drink with a colleague after a good day of hacking together! 🍻Can't wait to meet so many people i mostly speak with through slack in person - and see what we create together! 🦾
