I have a (very dense) book recommendation for you today: Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman.Most business books could be condensed into a simpler blog post, but "Thinking, Fast and Slow" stands apart for me.

Each chapter explores cognitive biases that are so fascinating and applicable to business and daily life that Kahneman could have expanded any single one into the book.

It's not just a book you read—it's one you revisit, each time discovering insights you somehow missed before.Daniel Kahneman's masterpiece fundamentally changed how I understand decision-making—both my own and within the teams I work with.

Based on decades of research that earned him a Nobel Prize, Kahneman invites us to look inside our own minds.The book reveals how our minds operate on two systems:"⚡️System 1: Fast, intuitive, and emotional"🤔System 2: Slow, deliberate, and logicalThe deeper insight isn't just that these two systems exist, but how often our fast-thinking System 1 hijacks our decision-making without us realizing it...🧠 Why does this matter for technology leaders?

When building products or leading teams, we constantly battle cognitive biases that cloud our judgment.

Understanding these biases isn't just academic – it's practical intelligence that improves how we:"✅ Make strategic decisions when faced with incomplete information "✅ Evaluate risk and opportunity more objectively "✅ Help teams overcome confirmation bias in problem-solvingOne of the most powerful concepts Kahneman introduces is "What You See Is All There Is" (WYSIATI) - our tendency to form opinions based only on available evidence, ignoring what we don't know.💡 How can you apply this?"- Ask yourself: "What information might I be missing?

What assumptions am I making that I haven't validated?- When team members present solutions, probe for the invisible: "What alternatives did you consider, and why did you discard them?- Create space for deliberate System 2 thinking before important decisionsWhen we recognize our thinking shortcuts, the implicit often becomes explicit.

Acknowledging our cognitive biases creates more room for innovation, collaboration, and sound decision-making.And I've focused on own teams - but the concepts in the book have ramifications on marketing and how we present a product, persuasive skills, negotiation...

It's really a handbook on how people think, and why so many times decisions are not "rational".Have you read this book?

Which cognitive bias do you find most relevant in your work?
