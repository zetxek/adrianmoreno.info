Very interesting panel discussion yesterday at WeWork, organized by Codemotion, with the tech leaders at Adyen, Schuberg Philis and Relay42.

The title was "How to Become a Good Tech Lead" and it was lead with the questions of the attendants, covering common doubts such as how to organize the teams at the company, how to align a non-tech company towards an agile approach, how they deal with bad colleagues or toxic employees and how to reward the good ones, or what technical leadership means to them.Something that I didn't find so mature is that the reaction we (as tech-involved audience and panellists) have to a question about how to manage stress and burnouts: we laugh. I think that's not taken too seriously, and it's easy to fall into the trap of idealizing long hours, just because we like what we do.The way I see it, work and life need to be balanced to be a successful person that is able to work and for that, the company needs to give you support to achieve it, but it also starts by taking one's mental health seriously.

It's not something to trivialize and assume that being burnt out and constantly low on energy is normal...#leadership #mentalhealth #balance #techPS: this is the Codemotion Meetup group: https://lnkd.in/eYPZ2qN
