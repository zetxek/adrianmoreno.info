Some matches are just destined to work. When Liza and I came in contact from Mirela from Product People we KNEW we had to do something together 🙌

They have such a great network of speakers and product-minded professionals, and give so much to the community. From SumUp we want to "give back" and contribute with our learnings on building an international product from SumUp and our Tribe - Liza will share some of the insights of how we have turned our "pain points" into processes that "just work" and bring people together as collaboration.

Let me advance that what we do is the result of multiple iterations...🔄

Join us next Thursday in Vesterbro, to talk in person, and learn from each other!!
