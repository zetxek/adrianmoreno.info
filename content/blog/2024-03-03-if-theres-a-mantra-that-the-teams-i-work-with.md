If there's a mantra that the teams I work with have heard me repeat endlessly is "making explicit the implicit".I use it as a way to encourage to document assumptions, reflect on the facts that drive our intuition, or the ways in which we have been biased (and we are not fully aware of).I find that trying to have factual conversations and write down what makes us take a decision helps create a more inclusive decision-making process, encouraging anyone to look at the same facts, and participate on it.Is this something you have too come across as a way to shape the teams interactions?
