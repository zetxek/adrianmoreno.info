It was a delight to talk with Elliot from Enginears a bit about how we organize ourselves at SumUp - and even more doing it side by side with Jan!As we mention in the podcast, cross-tribal collaboration is a big topic - minding the big picture, and how our teams fit into it.

What best to preach by example, in a tandem podcast where we share our outlook from two different angles 🔭I hope you enjoy this episode!
