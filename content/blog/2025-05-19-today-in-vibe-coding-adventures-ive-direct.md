Today, in "vibe coding adventures": I've directed Manus AI to:1. propose improvements to my website (adrianmoreno.info), without more instruction - to see where it would focus"2. understand that the code of my website is open source - but split in two repositories (theme and content)"3. implement the theme fixes in a way that are usable for anyone using the themeThe challenges faced were quite interesting."Manus could do a lot of the operations with github via API, but initially it refused and wanted me to copy/paste the code changes."Same with the improvements: initially it would propose changes that broke the theme.

Once I called out this - Manus "learned" and, in the very recognizable LLM style, apologized and proposed an alternative.

Which would be broken again.It was very important for me to be extra clear and explicit about what I expected.

For example, no unnecessary changes to the codebase, or making sure that the tests for the theme were passing - including rejecting to copy-paste the logs, so Manus would retrieve the result via API.In a way, it's like a stubborn and slightly lazy colleague... but it's relentless, apologetic, and gritty!#agenticai #manusai #aiassisteddevelopment
