Or how, as an industry, we have perverted "agile" so much that it means "I use Jira and put tickets in sprints", forgetting about the most barebones basics:Individuals and interactions over processes and tools"Working software over comprehensive documentation"Customer collaboration over contract negotiation"Responding to change over following a plan(and the correct Jira template!)
