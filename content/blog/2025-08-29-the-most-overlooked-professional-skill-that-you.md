The most overlooked professional skill that you can start practicing today:  curiosity 🧐In a world that rewards quick answers and surface-level knowledge, deep curiosity is a superpower.

It’s what gives you an edge that lasts.

Why?

Because anyone can learn what to do, and (especially in the vibe coding genAI era), how to do it.Those who succeed understand why it works, how it connects to the broader picture, and what happens next."They connect the dots between business, technology, and human behavior.

They see the system, not just the symptom.

They envision the possible paths that follow the immediate step.Iteration is the mother of progress, and curiosity fuels iterations guided by "what's next?".🤔How to practice it?

Ask these questions more often:Instead of "What does it do?" ask "Why was it designed this way?" and "What other options might they have considered?"."Instead of "Is it working?" ask "What is it actually achieving vs. the goal?What's the counterintuitive reason this succeeded/failed?🪏 The deepest insights lie just beneath the first layer of understanding.

Dig there.#Curiosity #ProfessionalGrowth #CriticalThinking #Leadership
