I've liked this talk from Randy Shoup about how to trust among your peers, because it can work in any environment:https://lnkd.in/eUvqGW8mAs tech "allies" we need to understand what value we deliver as a business and find our common goals, then build a plan and transparently and consistently deliver on it - and build a culture of accountability by transparency and keeping the promises.I like that there's no magic "hack" on it, but mainly to build a track record of keeping up the promises and iterate on it.
