Hey Amsterdam network ❌❌❌

I think this is a super cool position! (OK I'm biased because I _was doing_ the job until some weeks ago, when I became evangelizer 🚲 🤣)

But VanMoof is in a super interesting moment + great team (OK biased here too, they were my lovely team) + super interesting ecosystem around a great product (what's not to love about these ebikes?).

It's a great position for person with a mix of hands-on and managerial experience, to focus more on the team management (while staying close to tech).

If you want to know more about the role and how it was day to day, I can help #amsterdam #engineeringmanagers 👀
