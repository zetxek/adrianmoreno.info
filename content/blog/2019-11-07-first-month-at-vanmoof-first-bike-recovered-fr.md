First month at VanMoof, first bike recovered from the thieves! 🕵️‍♂️ (I star at 4:32, supervising 😂)Some context: VanMoof's bikes are tracked via GPS when stolen, and with the Peace of Mind service, we will get them wherever they are.

Sometimes in Amsterdam, sometimes a but more far away, sometimes in the other corner of the world - but the customer gets their bike back!

And as part of the onboarding process at VanMoof, you go on a bikehunt to recover some of the stolen ones
