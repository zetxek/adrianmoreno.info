These thoughts from Sam have resonated with me - especially the bit about the uncertain world.

That's a problem I'm loving to learn more about with Worksome (and hopefully contribute to a solution and new ways of working).We completely divide the workforce in "temporary" (contingent, freelancer, etc) workers and "permanent".

And there's nothing permanent!

The current global landscape is fully "VUCA" (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) - there's no certainty - so nothing "permanent".When the hiring process is only catered for the "perm positions", with all the due diligence in place, and a broken hiring marketplace (companies want to hire and don't find talent, talent can't find the opportunities), you just end slowing down your business, and the hires will join you systematically delayed (when the opportunity might have died already).Having the power of hiring on demand, when it's needed and for what people are best for is a superpower to adapt to the current landscape and take advantage of opportunity as it comes - instead of delaying it until the budget allows for a FTE to join, there's a candidate pool built, hiring process has gone through end to end... A constantly changing world requires an adaptable and flexible way of working.
