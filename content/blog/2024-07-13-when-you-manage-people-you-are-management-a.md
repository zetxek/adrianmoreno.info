When you manage people you are "management" - and you now have a new team you're part of (in addition to your own).I have seen how difficult this can be, especially for first-time managers.

Before, it could have been enough to point out situations that needed solutions.

Now, with the title comes the responsibility: whatever needs to be fixed is part of your job description now.One of the key responsibilities of a manager is to foster alignment across various areas, teams, and functions.

This is not just a part of the job, but a crucial aspect of effective management - and many middle-managers might feel trapped if they don't create the right connections.

Your actions, decisions, and behavior reflect on the entire organization.

Your team looks to you for guidance, support, and leadership.

Your colleagues see you as representing the company's values and culture.

Your "team" is now the rest of the company managers you work with... like it or not.

And you better like it - because you'll also be held accountable as part of that group.As a manager, it's vital to cultivate an environment where dissent is not only tolerated but encouraged, as long as it's expressed constructively.

This is especially important because your team will look up to you as a role model.
