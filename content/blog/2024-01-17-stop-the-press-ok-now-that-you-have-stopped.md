STOP THE PRESS 🛑"(ok, now that you have stopped: share with your network and get Karma points with me :-)I share some cool jobs from SumUp here and there.

Today, I bring you THE JOB.

You can join not only SumUp (cool) but our team in Copenhagen (double cool) and the Invoices Tribe (triple cool) in Bruno's team.We are seeking a new colleague to join us as an Android developer for the Accounting squad.

With a very well-located office in the center of Copenhagen, daily lunch together, and a chance to influence new product creation.

We are tackling really interesting problems and working with a lot of greenfield technology in the product we're ramping up, automating expense management.

While we are part of SumUp (with all the 💪 that it implies), we are about 20 people in the Copenhagen office - which we run as our "small startup" and our "hygge traditions".

Best of both worlds!

🇩🇰🌍If you have any questions - I'm going to be very biased, but I will be excited to tell you everything about what we are building 🚀.
