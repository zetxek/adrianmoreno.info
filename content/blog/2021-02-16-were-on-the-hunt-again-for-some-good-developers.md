We're on the hunt again for some good developers!

Ambitious plans need bold people - and this is a great chance to join VanMoof and help us shape a delightful experience for our customers.

Our bikes are smart, have a clean iconic design - and that's how our website should be in the frontend and the backend!

Stack-wise we have mostly PHP and Javascript, deployed on the cloud. And you will have the chance to have an impact on every stage of the system and the process.

And you will join smart and nice colleagues like Pepijn and George. What's not to love! 🚲
