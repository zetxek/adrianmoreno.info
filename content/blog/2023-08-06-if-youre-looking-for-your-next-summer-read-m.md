If you're looking for your next summer read - maybe this one catches your eye 👀 (if it goes as it went with me).Scaling People: Tactics for Management and Company Building, by Claire Hughes Johnson is a fantastic book. I enjoyed reading if from the beginning to the end - and in opposition to many business or strategy books, I found it very insightful.When I read some of the reference books on how to treat people I feel that I have read a "glorified blogpost", that comes to be "be kind to people".

But Claire goes quite some steps ahead, with specific examples and learning opportunities; as well as lightweight processes to prevent these situations as the company scales.The writing style makes it completely relatable and approachable - and every page is full of really good advice.

It touches complicated and complex topics with a light sense of humour, that kept me engaged during the whole book.If you're looking for inspiration on how to setup internal processes, hiring pipelines, feedback processes or performance evaluations - you might as well take a look to Scaling People.Thanks Tobias for the recommendation! 💯#bookrecommendation #scalingpeople #organizationaldesign
