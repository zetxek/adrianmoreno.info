Sunsetting 2024 with some relax… and thankfulness!

🏖️The end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025 are being quite unique for me - as I’m writing from the beach at 30 degrees, far from the near-freezing temperatures at home.

I am starting 2025 with my parental leave - which is quite unique on its own already, but to add an extra touch, I’m taking my SumUp Sabbatical month (our great Break for me*), and enjoying a paid month off work while I’m traveling with my wife and 9-month old baby in Thailand 😱

Personally, it will be quite some firsts for me. Otto is our first son, I had never been to Asia, and I had never been off work for longer than 3 weeks or so - so being out for 3+ months will be quite an experience.

I expect time to bond with Otto, to spend quality time with him, and to build memories together as a family.

Reflecting on this chance - it just fills me with gratefulness for having this opportunity, as it takes a whole team to be able to “disappear” from work for so long with a great peace of mind of knowing that things will be very well taken care of.

I’m actually looking forward to coming back and seeing the progress in my “absent quarter”! 🚀

*PS: would you like to enjoy this awesome perk of the sabbatical month? Check our positions at https://lnkd.in/dq4g9xDE (we currently have one open in our tribe, and keep an eye out for new ones open soon! 🔜). Just mind that other sumuppers will handle your application as I'll be off duty! 🧑‍🧒
