💳 In a time where payments get more expensive in the Nordics - from SumUp we've gone the opposite direction, and lowered fees in Denmark to 0.89% (from 1.49%).If you know a small merchant in Denmark that could use lower fees on their payments - drop me a line! I'll be happy to pass by in person in the Copenhagen area and help with the initial setup 🧑‍💻Also, our (affordable) card readers can be found very conveniently in retail channels like Bilka, Salling Group, Elgiganten A/S, Proshop a/s, Komplett Group, Brdr. A&O Johansen A/S or Dustin 🏪 - thanks for making us so available Anders Fagerlund Nielsen#payments #denmark #sumupdenmark
