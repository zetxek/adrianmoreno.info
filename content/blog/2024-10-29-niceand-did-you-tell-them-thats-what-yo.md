Nice!

And... did you tell them?" 💭That's what you will hear me asking when I get "second-hand feedback" about someone else - both positive or negative.

If you have worked with me it's likely that you've heard this at some point :)We tend to assume that "they probably know".

But think about how many times you have been in doubt about the impact that you have on others, if you make a difference on their days; and especially: what exactly brought them joy, or frustrated who you interacted with.Next time that you have a positive interaction - let them know!

And when you have ideas on how they can do better - let them know!

More often than not, your feedback will be welcome, appreciated - and you can make a difference to others - one day you might get that feedback back (which is a gift 🎁).
