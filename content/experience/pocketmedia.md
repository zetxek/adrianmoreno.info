### First time leading a multi-cultural team

At Pocket Media I lead the tech team of the company, in a process of product creation and launch to market. I was a member of the management team of the company, and lead up to 10 FTE, in charge of hiring, role definition, and performance management.

As part of my (team) tasks, I executed mobile and web (high scalability) development projects. I defined the products roadmap, milestones, and plans to achieve the objectives, as well as the
talent acquisition.

The company focus as an advertisement agency was strongly towards app installs and mobile entertainment, and the product definition spiralled around those verticals. The focus of the native advertisement platform we developed was in customisability, ease to adopt by mobile and web developers and media, and transparency towards the partners.
