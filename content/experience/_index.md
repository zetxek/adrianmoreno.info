I have architected and developed digital products, led cross-functional teams, and scaled engineering organizations, always with a focus on delivering impactful solutions and fostering high-performing, psychologically safe environments. My trajectory reflects a blend of deep technical expertise and a passion for mentoring, process improvement, and driving business outcomes through technology.
