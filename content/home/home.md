    description="Based in Copenhagen 🇩🇰, I work at <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://www.worksome.com/'>Worksome</a>, a Danish company redefining how businesses and independent professionals collaborate — empowering companies to adapt to the future of work.<br/><br/>With <strong>nearly two decades of experience</strong> across Spain, the Netherlands, and Denmark, I've grown from individual contributor to VP of Engineering. I thrive in diverse, multi-cultural environments and bring a unique blend of technical depth and business acumen — from architecting scalable platforms to owning P&amp;L responsibility.<br/><br/>I'm grounded in the <strong>3P framework: People, Product, Process</strong>. Whether refining delivery practices, mentoring future leaders, or driving product strategy, I focus on shaping environments where both products <em>and</em> people thrive."

{{< about-section
    title="Who am I?"
    content="<p class='lead'>An engineer at heart and a leader by practice. I channel curiosity and energy into building teams that deliver technology with real business impact. You'll find me debugging code with engineers one hour and aligning product strategy with stakeholders the next.</p><p>After co-founding a startup and growing through IC, CTO, and VP roles, I learned to bridge business vision and technical execution — scaling systems, mentoring teams, and advocating for user-centric design across industries like SaaS, e-commerce, fintech, and mobile.</p><p>My leadership thrives on three principles:</p><ol><li><strong>Empathy as a Superpower:</strong> I believe in <em>making explicit the implicit</em> — understanding diverse perspectives fuels better decisions and stronger collaboration.</li><li><strong>Multi-disciplinary Teams &amp; Breaking Silos:</strong> DevOps practices, cross-functional ownership, and the right agile <em>for the team</em> — not agile 'the right way'.</li><li><strong>Iterative Improvement:</strong> Progress is a cycle of experimentation, feedback, and refinement. Action speaks louder than words.</li></ol><p><strong>My superpower?</strong> Versatility with business sense. From architecting backend systems to owning P&amp;L, I connect dots across disciplines. But technology alone isn't the answer — I obsess over <em>how</em> teams work, fostering psychological safety and iterative learning.</p>"
