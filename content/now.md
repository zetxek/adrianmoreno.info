# What I'm up to now

*Last updated: February 2026*

## Work

I'm **Head of Engineering at [Worksome](https://www.worksome.com/)** in Copenhagen, leading Product, Engineering & Design. We're building a Freelance Management System and marketplace that helps companies find, hire, and manage freelance talent compliantly and at scale.

I'm driving adoption of **gen-AI tools and processes** across the engineering organization — from code generation and AI-assisted data analysis to agentic coding for DevOps automation.

## Writing & Thinking

Themes I keep coming back to:

- **Empathy in engineering leadership** — making explicit the implicit, building trust across functions
- **Breaking silos** — multi-disciplinary teams, DevOps culture, cross-functional ownership
- **AI in engineering workflows** — practical adoption, not hype
- **The business side of engineering** — P&L thinking, sustainable product strategies, balancing speed with cost-control

I publish mostly on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrianmoreno/) and archive longer pieces on my [blog](/blog).

## Reading

Always have a book going. Currently exploring themes around decision-making, organizational design, and the intersection of technology and human behavior. Check my full [reading list](/books).

## Outside work

- Living in Copenhagen (Valby) with my wife and son
- Active in the local triathlon community ([/tri club denmark](https://www.triclubdenmark.dk/))
- Board member experience across sports clubs in Spain, Amsterdam, and Denmark
