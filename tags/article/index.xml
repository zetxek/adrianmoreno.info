&lt;p>Here’s why these two books are secret weapons for technologists who want to spark passion, and not only &amp;ldquo;convince with data&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🔧 Swapping Tools to Fix Systemic Issues?</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-06-16-swapping-tools-to-fix-systemic-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 18:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-06-16-swapping-tools-to-fix-systemic-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQHC0sEs9UB7hg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re been in business enough, you have seen it before. Especially by new teams or colleagues, that need to prove themselves quick and make a mark: &lt;em>“Our processes are broken! Quick—switch project management tool!”&lt;/em> &lt;em>“Collaboration sucks? Swap the documentation platform!”&lt;/em> &lt;em>“Quality’s down? NEW DEPLOYMENT TOOL. NOW.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the recurring themes in discussions of psychological safety and leading teams through change is transparency. In the current digital age, data is ubiquitously generated and abundant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leads to an issue I have seen: giving access to the data is not enough to grant you transparency. Data can be interpreted in multiple ways, it can have very varying levels of trustworthiness and a&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making explicit the implicit: Exploring parallel universes while creating alignment</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-03-making-explicit-the-implicit-exploring-parallel-un/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 18:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-03-making-explicit-the-implicit-exploring-parallel-un/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQGY8axfaTOJXA" alt="In a way, creating something together is like exploring the ">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Making explicit the implicit&lt;/em> might be my most repeated mantra when working with software development teams - or product development by extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When working in a technological context, with interrelated products, you are constantly faced with complex and ambiguous problems that require creative and innovative solutions. You have to make decisions based on incomplete or conflicting information, and communicate them effectively to your team and stakeholders. You also have to deal with the human and emotional aspects of leading people, such as motivating, coaching, and resolving conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Purposeful Incentives: Shaping Behaviors for Long-Term Success</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-12-17-the-power-of-purposeful-incentives-shaping-behavio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 21:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-12-17-the-power-of-purposeful-incentives-shaping-behavio/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQEkgqjYgHd3XQ" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When people look up to you, you need to consider the incentives you set. Incentives are not just about giving rewards or punishments, but also about making sure your team members share the same goals, values and behaviors as your organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Incentives can make a big difference in how your organization works, and how people work together, talk to each other and come up with new ideas&lt;/strong>. Incentives can also help people do better, learn more and grow in their careers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Developing our empathy to be better colleagues and leaders</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-05-28-developing-our-empathy-to-be-better-colleagues-and/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2023 12:47:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-05-28-developing-our-empathy-to-be-better-colleagues-and/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4E12AQFOEy41G1LdDg" alt="Generated with midjourney 5">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I often get asked what skills are most useful to develop to be a successful leader. I want to make a case for making &lt;strong>empathy&lt;/strong> a top tool in our skillset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Empathy is the ability to &lt;em>detect and understand other people’s feelings&lt;/em>. It’s a skill that we can all improve through training and practice. Empathy is not only good for our personal relationships but also for our professional ones. It can help us reduce stress, build more positive relationships, and even boost revenues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The power of habit: from "I hate running"​ to "You are an Ironman"​</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-21-the-power-of-habit-from-i-hate-running-to-you-are/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-21-the-power-of-habit-from-i-hate-running-to-you-are/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaC4E12AQGO9tsuCBji3Q" alt="Ironman Italy 2021, shining at the finish line after 11h46 of effort">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The year is 2015. I see myself on a pic in the company slack and think &amp;ldquo;how unflattering it is&amp;rdquo;. I had moved to Amsterdam and lost my exercise routine, consisting in playing football with my friends at the local league.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I had to accept it: the pic was not unflattering - I came to terms with it and started running, because it was very convenient: no gym subscription, no schedules, and could go out any time. Only one downside: I &lt;strong>hated&lt;/strong> it. It was the part I disliked the most of football training - but somehow I convinced myself &amp;ldquo;endure, focus on smaller objectives and just do it&amp;rdquo;. So I&amp;rsquo;d focus on getting to the next street light, to the next crossing - and celebrate small achievements: &amp;ldquo;today I ran 1km without stopping&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;my longest run of 5km!&amp;rdquo;, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2018-06-16-last-friday-night-tgif/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2018-06-16-last-friday-night-tgif/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaC4E12AQHHlCymB1TMtA" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago we organized the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Mobile-Advertising-Meetup/events/229148242/">1st Pocket Media&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Advertising Meetup of 2016&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of the Meetup is sharing some of the knowledge we&amp;rsquo;ve been acquiring in these 4 years in the industry, while also involving the interesting voices that other marketers, advertisers and publishers have in The Netherlands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the feedback is being really good, with very interesting insights shared by key people in the industry, and creating a really nice group of people interested in networking and exploring collaboration options.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
