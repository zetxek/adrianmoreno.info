&lt;p>The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;, in general. The problem, as with most tools, is how we use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too many people treat AI as a peer—an equal collaborator they can blindly trust. This is a catastrophic mistake, and quite quickly leads to losing credibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🤔 What have I found that works best for me? Act as a Supervisor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Treat your AI like a brilliant, hyper-enthusiastic junior intern. It will tirelessly draft, ideate, and execute exactly what it thinks you asked for. But a good supervisor doesn&amp;rsquo;t just delegate and disappear.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🔧 Swapping Tools to Fix Systemic Issues?</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-06-16-swapping-tools-to-fix-systemic-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Jun 2025 18:29:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-06-16-swapping-tools-to-fix-systemic-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQHC0sEs9UB7hg" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re been in business enough, you have seen it before. Especially by new teams or colleagues, that need to prove themselves quick and make a mark: &lt;em>“Our processes are broken! Quick—switch project management tool!”&lt;/em> &lt;em>“Collaboration sucks? Swap the documentation platform!”&lt;/em> &lt;em>“Quality’s down? NEW DEPLOYMENT TOOL. NOW.”&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>🏖️The end of 2024 and the beginning of 2025 are being quite unique for me - as I’m writing from the beach at 30 degrees, far from the near-freezing temperatures at home.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am starting 2025 with my parental leave - which is quite unique on its own already, but to add an extra touch, I’m taking my SumUp Sabbatical month (our great Break for me*), and enjoying a paid month off work while I’m traveling with my wife and 9-month old baby in Thailand 😱&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>- 💡A mind shift to start being part of the solu...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-08-23-a-mind-shift-to-start-being-part-of-the-solu/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Aug 2024 21:28:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-08-23-a-mind-shift-to-start-being-part-of-the-solu/</guid><description>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>💡A mind shift to start being part of the solution, instead of tolerating broken things: replace &amp;ldquo;it&amp;rsquo;s not my job&amp;rdquo; with &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s find out how to solve this&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>🪟The broken windows theory states that visible signs of crime or antisocial behavior encourage further crimes - leading to an escalation in violence. The same thing can happen in a workplace when small things are observed that do not work as they should, and no one does anything to fix or prevent them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Making explicit the implicit: Exploring parallel universes while creating alignment</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-03-making-explicit-the-implicit-exploring-parallel-un/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 18:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-03-making-explicit-the-implicit-exploring-parallel-un/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQGY8axfaTOJXA" alt="In a way, creating something together is like exploring the ">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Making explicit the implicit&lt;/em> might be my most repeated mantra when working with software development teams - or product development by extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When working in a technological context, with interrelated products, you are constantly faced with complex and ambiguous problems that require creative and innovative solutions. You have to make decisions based on incomplete or conflicting information, and communicate them effectively to your team and stakeholders. You also have to deal with the human and emotional aspects of leading people, such as motivating, coaching, and resolving conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This.</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-26-this/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Feb 2024 21:56:32 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-26-this/</guid><description>&lt;p>This.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When a conversation reaches by DM, send it to a channel (either private or public depending on context).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And nudging team members to understand that posting in a public channel is not spamming, given the right etiquette (right tagging - so not @here to say good morning; right context setting, using threads for related follow ups)…&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Power of Purposeful Incentives: Shaping Behaviors for Long-Term Success</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-12-17-the-power-of-purposeful-incentives-shaping-behavio/</link><pubDate>Sun, 17 Dec 2023 21:44:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-12-17-the-power-of-purposeful-incentives-shaping-behavio/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQEkgqjYgHd3XQ" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When people look up to you, you need to consider the incentives you set. Incentives are not just about giving rewards or punishments, but also about making sure your team members share the same goals, values and behaviors as your organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Incentives can make a big difference in how your organization works, and how people work together, talk to each other and come up with new ideas&lt;/strong>. Incentives can also help people do better, learn more and grow in their careers.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Really looking forward to this! 🥳</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-09-09-really-looking-forward-to-this/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:16:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-09-09-really-looking-forward-to-this/</guid><description>&lt;p>Really looking forward to this! 🥳&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a world of working through online tools - I especially enjoy the moment of complicity of working on something together sharing a desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Organic conversations without having to raise a hand or check who was next at the queue - only to get a drink with a colleague after a good day of hacking together! 🍻&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to meet so many people i mostly speak with through slack in person - and see what we create together! 🦾&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Genchi Genbutsu: "go and see".</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-02-19-genchi-genbutsu-go-and-see/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Feb 2023 15:14:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-02-19-genchi-genbutsu-go-and-see/</guid><description>&lt;p>Genchi Genbutsu: &amp;ldquo;go and see&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a manager, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to rely on your team to tell how things are working, and gradually lose contact with the process on itself. The problems they face, the challenges they solve, the issues they experience in their day to day - will flow through your interactions with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there&amp;rsquo;s no replacement for seeing it with your own eyes, and understanding it by yourself, from first-party data. The practice of &amp;ldquo;Genchi Genbutsu&amp;rdquo; comes from the Toyota Production System, and it&amp;rsquo;s not meant to &amp;ldquo;physically observe everything&amp;rdquo;, but more as gathering data by yourself, and &amp;ldquo;cutting the middleman&amp;rdquo; when doing observations about how things are running.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2021 has been... quite a year 🤪</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-23-2021-has-been-quite-a-year/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 08:42:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-23-2021-has-been-quite-a-year/</guid><description>&lt;p>2021 has been&amp;hellip; quite a year 🤪&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neck down in the not-so-ending pandemic, surfing through covid variants, country lockdowns and all the uncertainties that this brings (will I be able to travel? To take holidays? To go to a concert?), and all the doubts of being in a situation that we had not been before.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Luckily in tech we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to adapt quite quickly and efficiently to this new &amp;ldquo;work from home&amp;rdquo; as default - but that has come with quite a toll on how we interact with each other, the boundaries between work and time off, and the possibility of disconnecting from work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The power of habit: from "I hate running"​ to "You are an Ironman"​</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-21-the-power-of-habit-from-i-hate-running-to-you-are/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 19:49:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-21-the-power-of-habit-from-i-hate-running-to-you-are/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaC4E12AQGO9tsuCBji3Q" alt="Ironman Italy 2021, shining at the finish line after 11h46 of effort">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The year is 2015. I see myself on a pic in the company slack and think &amp;ldquo;how unflattering it is&amp;rdquo;. I had moved to Amsterdam and lost my exercise routine, consisting in playing football with my friends at the local league.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I had to accept it: the pic was not unflattering - I came to terms with it and started running, because it was very convenient: no gym subscription, no schedules, and could go out any time. Only one downside: I &lt;strong>hated&lt;/strong> it. It was the part I disliked the most of football training - but somehow I convinced myself &amp;ldquo;endure, focus on smaller objectives and just do it&amp;rdquo;. So I&amp;rsquo;d focus on getting to the next street light, to the next crossing - and celebrate small achievements: &amp;ldquo;today I ran 1km without stopping&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;my longest run of 5km!&amp;rdquo;, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2018-06-16-last-friday-night-tgif/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2018 13:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2018-06-16-last-friday-night-tgif/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaC4E12AQHHlCymB1TMtA" alt="">&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A couple of weeks ago we organized the &lt;a href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Mobile-Advertising-Meetup/events/229148242/">1st Pocket Media&amp;rsquo;s Mobile Advertising Meetup of 2016&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The idea of the Meetup is sharing some of the knowledge we&amp;rsquo;ve been acquiring in these 4 years in the industry, while also involving the interesting voices that other marketers, advertisers and publishers have in The Netherlands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far the feedback is being really good, with very interesting insights shared by key people in the industry, and creating a really nice group of people interested in networking and exploring collaboration options.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Lista de Google Groups</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2012-04-17-lista-de-google-groups/</link><pubDate>Tue, 17 Apr 2012 23:03:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2012-04-17-lista-de-google-groups/</guid><description>&lt;p>Lista de Google Groups&lt;/p>
