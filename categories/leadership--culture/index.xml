And&amp;hellip; did you tell them?&amp;quot; 💭&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s what you will hear me asking when I get &amp;ldquo;second-hand feedback&amp;rdquo; about someone else - both positive or negative. If you have worked with me it&amp;rsquo;s likely that you&amp;rsquo;ve heard this at some point :)&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;We tend to assume that &amp;ldquo;they probably know&amp;rdquo;. But think about how many times you have been in doubt about the impact that you have on others, if you make a difference on their days; and especially: what exactly brought them joy, or frustrated who you interacted with.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Next time that you have a positive interaction - let them know! And when you have ideas on how they can do better - let them know! &amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;More often than not, your feedback will be welcome, appreciated - and you can make a difference to others - one day you might get that feedback back (which is a gift 🎁). &amp;quot;

&lt;p&gt;I often get asked what skills are most useful to develop to be a successful leader. I want to make a case for making &lt;strong&gt;empathy&lt;/strong&gt; a top tool in our skillset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empathy is the ability to &lt;em&gt;detect and understand other people’s feelings&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a skill that we can all improve through training and practice. Empathy is not only good for our personal relationships but also for our professional ones. It can help us reduce stress, build more positive relationships, and even boost revenues.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
