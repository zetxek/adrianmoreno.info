&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Time flies (when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun), and it&amp;rsquo;s about to be two months here. I&amp;rsquo;m (especially) excited as we have the first job opening in my team, working directly with the great Lucas &amp;amp; his team, to work from the (greatly located office) in Copenhagen.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;We have a strong focus on the Laravel ecosystem (and Vue in the frontend), but the most important aspect is that we are a truly flat team, where engineering has a significant say in how we build our product. That makes the job ideal for someone who wants to develop a digital product and solve customer problems (using technology, of course). &amp;quot;
&amp;quot; &amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;If you have someone in mind, feel free to put us in contact! &amp;quot;

Management is. 🧭</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-02-27-leadership-isnt-a-job-title-management-is/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 09:01:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-02-27-leadership-isnt-a-job-title-management-is/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Leadership isn’t a job title. Management is. 🧭&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Let’s clear something up: Leadership and management get mixed around like synonyms, but they’re different concepts. Sometimes they overlap, but they&amp;rsquo;re not the same.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Here’s the thing:&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;✅ Anyone can lead – Influence, inspire, take ownership. That’s leadership.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;✅ Managers manage – Hire, budget, execute. That’s a specific job.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;But here’s the trap: When we act like “leadership” is code for “managers only,” we tell the rest of the team: “Your voice doesn’t matter; leave this to us.”&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Worse? We end up with managers who manage processes but don’t lead people. And teams waiting for permission instead of stepping up.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;📚 A book that puts this greatly is &amp;ldquo;Turn the ship around!&amp;rdquo;, by L. David Marquet. A submarine captain flipped the script on the traditional “leader-follower” model—where only the person at the top “leads”—and instead built a “leader-leader” culture. His secret? Leadership wasn’t about authority. It was about empowering everyone to make decisions, regardless of rank. The result? A crew that didn’t just follow orders… they owned outcomes.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Next time you hear, &amp;ldquo;I would like a leadership position, but I have no team to manage 🙁&amp;rdquo; remember this vital difference and encourage anyone to lead from wherever they are. &amp;quot;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Leadership isn’t reserved or limited. It should be spread and encouraged to grow anywhere in your teams 💪. As leaders, we must make sure that everyone at the &amp;ldquo;edges of the organization&amp;rdquo; has the right context to keep alignment with the shared goals and mission, and information to decide by themselves.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is a super cool position! (OK I&amp;rsquo;m biased because I &lt;em&gt;was doing&lt;/em&gt; the job until some weeks ago, when I became evangelizer 🚲 🤣)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But VanMoof is in a super interesting moment + great team (OK biased here too, they were my lovely team) + super interesting ecosystem around a great product (what&amp;rsquo;s not to love about these ebikes?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a great position for person with a mix of hands-on and managerial experience, to focus more on the team management (while staying close to tech).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Talent is overrated.

&lt;p&gt;What can you do in small ways everyday that would make it easy to take the necessary steps to pursue your life-long goals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perseverance and resilience have a lot to do with success than you think.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
