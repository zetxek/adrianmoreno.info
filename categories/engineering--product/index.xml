It&amp;rsquo;s our go-to metaphor, and it works - people understand debt. But &lt;strong>we&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at sustainability through only one lens.&lt;/strong> We obsess over code quality, architecture, test coverage - and we call the absence of these things &amp;ldquo;technical debt&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What we rarely talk about is the &lt;strong>literal&lt;/strong> debt. &lt;strong>Code that is technically good but the business can&amp;rsquo;t afford to maintain is not good code.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>📥 Importing my LinkedIn archive into Hugo</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-25-importing-my-linkedin-archive-into-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-25-importing-my-linkedin-archive-into-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>For years I’ve been publishing on LinkedIn. And for years I’ve had the same discomfort: it’s my content, but it lives in someone else’s garden. That&amp;rsquo;s why initially I liked &amp;ldquo;blogging&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s mainly fun if you have an audience (which LinkedIn gives you access to).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LinkedIn is increasingly a walled garden (and getting more aggressive about external links), so I wanted a way to keep &lt;em>my own words&lt;/em> on &lt;em>my own website&lt;/em>, without paying yet another platform subscription for the privilege.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🦄 Why Engineers Need "Alchemy": Beyond Factual Correctness to Human Magic</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-07-30-why-engineers-need-alchemy-beyond-factual-correctn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2025 20:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-07-30-why-engineers-need-alchemy-beyond-factual-correctn/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://media.licdn.com/mediaD4D12AQGpqiqocFEPFw" alt="Created with microsoft copilot">&lt;/p>

I especially enjoyed reading it after Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s book, to add a bit of color to the &amp;ldquo;cognitive biases&amp;rdquo; more as to what they are: how we think and make decisions. &amp;quot;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here’s why these two books are secret weapons for technologists who want to spark passion, and not only &amp;ldquo;convince with data&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Some matches are just destined to work.

When Liza and I came in contact from Mirela from Product People we KNEW we had to do something together 🙌&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They have such a great network of speakers and product-minded professionals, and give so much to the community. From SumUp we want to &amp;ldquo;give back&amp;rdquo; and contribute with our learnings on building an international product from SumUp and our Tribe - Liza will share some of the insights of how we have turned our &amp;ldquo;pain points&amp;rdquo; into processes that &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo; and bring people together as collaboration.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Didactic transparency</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-06-22-didactic-transparency/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Jun 2024 10:12:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-06-22-didactic-transparency/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="didactic-transparency">Didactic transparency&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>One of the recurring themes in discussions of psychological safety and leading teams through change is transparency. In the current digital age, data is ubiquitously generated and abundant.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This leads to an issue I have seen: giving access to the data is not enough to grant you transparency. Data can be interpreted in multiple ways, it can have very varying levels of trustworthiness and a&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This.</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-11-19-this/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2023 21:28:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-11-19-this/</guid><description>&lt;p>This.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a separate &amp;ldquo;engineering roadmap&amp;rdquo; to start with. Same as &amp;ldquo;product roadmap&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;marketing roadmap&amp;rdquo;, or &amp;ldquo;design roadmap&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(get your Freddy Mercury karaoke vibe and mentally repeat) One team, one vision - one roadmap, no division 🎸&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The capacity of the team should be looked at as a holistic system, and the leaders should align on how to use the capacity across all teams best. What&amp;rsquo;s the point of having a &amp;ldquo;product roadmap&amp;rdquo; that leads to invisible technical debt being introduced, that will slow down your team as tangled ropes on your team wheels?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>What a blast this event is!</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-05-12-what-a-blast-this-event-is/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 May 2022 15:06:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-05-12-what-a-blast-this-event-is/</guid><description>&lt;p>What a blast this event is!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m having such a great time joining others&amp;rsquo; ideas and following David and Sandy Phi direction &amp;ndash; and being back to contributing as an engineer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pairing up with other engineers while unrusting my DevOps skills (from idea to deployment in one day!), reviewing ideas together, and thinking how the creative ideas we&amp;rsquo;re coming with can help our merchants be more successful ⚡️&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And especially - meeting colleagues that I interact on a daily basis in person!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We're on the hunt again for some good developers!</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-02-16-were-on-the-hunt-again-for-some-good-developers/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Feb 2021 16:29:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-02-16-were-on-the-hunt-again-for-some-good-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re on the hunt again for some good developers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ambitious plans need bold people - and this is a great chance to join VanMoof and help us shape a delightful experience for our customers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our bikes are smart, have a clean iconic design - and that&amp;rsquo;s how our website should be in the frontend and the backend!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stack-wise we have mostly PHP and Javascript, deployed on the cloud. And you will have the chance to have an impact on every stage of the system and the process.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
