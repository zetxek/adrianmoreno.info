&lt;p>While you own the data you post here, LinkedIn makes it quite hard to access it in any way other than browsing their site. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t really scale for automated usage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the other hand, they are also known for their fight against scrapers and applications that try to access data from the network in an automated manner&amp;hellip; and their APIs are quite lacking (purposefully, as the goal is to keep all data within).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>📥 Importing my LinkedIn archive into Hugo</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-25-importing-my-linkedin-archive-into-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-25-importing-my-linkedin-archive-into-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>For years I’ve been publishing on LinkedIn. And for years I’ve had the same discomfort: it’s my content, but it lives in someone else’s garden. That&amp;rsquo;s why initially I liked &amp;ldquo;blogging&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s mainly fun if you have an audience (which LinkedIn gives you access to).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>LinkedIn is increasingly a walled garden (and getting more aggressive about external links), so I wanted a way to keep &lt;em>my own words&lt;/em> on &lt;em>my own website&lt;/em>, without paying yet another platform subscription for the privilege.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I can't really understand the obsession with "p...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-24-i-cant-really-understand-the-obsession-with-p/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 13:01:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-24-i-cant-really-understand-the-obsession-with-p/</guid><description>&lt;p>I can&amp;rsquo;t really understand the obsession with &amp;ldquo;protecting developers&amp;rdquo; and preventing them from speaking with clients. It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of infantilising and applying a &amp;ldquo;manufacturing chain&amp;rdquo; mindset to a work that is far from being &amp;ldquo;industrializable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Talking to your users - therefore to your clients - is when you learn 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every client call I join at Worksome is a chance for accelerated learning 🤓.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To &amp;ldquo;sell&amp;rdquo; the product and explain how it addresses potential clients&amp;rsquo; needs, I first need to understand how they do business. And staffing is not &amp;ldquo;the business&amp;rdquo; by itself in many cases. The business our clients operate in might be the creative world, regulated industries, or consumer products, and they might need to hire and manage freelancers, on top of many other responsibilities they need to manage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Since joining Worksome, I have been engaged in ...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-23-since-joining-worksome-i-have-been-engaged-in/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:47:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-12-23-since-joining-worksome-i-have-been-engaged-in/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since joining Worksome, I have been engaged in intense experimentation with (agentic) AI.

&lt;p>This era of software engineering is the perfect moment to reconnect with our skills.

&lt;p>This is the way I&amp;rsquo;d recommend approaching both looking for a job and keeping an eye on the market.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d add a few more tips:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep an eye on local-specific sites or portals - such as The Hub for the Nordics.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Leverage the local meetups as well (many of the companies sponsoring them are usually hiring, as it&amp;rsquo;s part of the employer branding).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🪄AI isn’t replacing people, it’s freeing them t...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-11-04-ai-isnt-replacing-people-its-freeing-them-t/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Nov 2025 21:21:55 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-11-04-ai-isnt-replacing-people-its-freeing-them-t/</guid><description>&lt;p>🪄AI isn’t replacing people, it’s freeing them to do more meaningful work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At Worksome&amp;rsquo;s Product Innovation Webinar on November 13, I’ll be talking about &amp;ldquo;The Art of Possibility&amp;rdquo;, exploring how AI and human collaboration are shaping the next phase of workforce management.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’ll look at what’s coming next, from intelligent systems that predict workforce needs to tools that make collaboration between humans and technology more seamless.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The problem isn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo;, in general. The problem, as with most tools, is how we use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Too many people treat AI as a peer—an equal collaborator they can blindly trust. This is a catastrophic mistake, and quite quickly leads to losing credibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🤔 What have I found that works best for me? Act as a Supervisor.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Treat your AI like a brilliant, hyper-enthusiastic junior intern. It will tirelessly draft, ideate, and execute exactly what it thinks you asked for. But a good supervisor doesn&amp;rsquo;t just delegate and disappear.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Frustrated your team won't change?

&lt;p>The solution starts in the mirror 🪞We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there: you want either to change or start a new behaviour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maybe to be more proactive, more collaborative, more curious - you name it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But the change just doesn&amp;rsquo;t stick.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s tried once, and abandoned.Before you get frustrated, think of this: Are you modelling the behavior you&amp;rsquo;re asking for?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behaviors stick through repetition and are adopted by mimicry, not by command.Do as I say, not as I do&amp;quot; won&amp;rsquo;t cut it when people look up to you.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The most overlooked professional skill that you...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-08-29-the-most-overlooked-professional-skill-that-you/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Aug 2025 18:22:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-08-29-the-most-overlooked-professional-skill-that-you/</guid><description>&lt;p>The most overlooked professional skill that you can start practicing today: curiosity 🧐In a world that rewards quick answers and surface-level knowledge, deep curiosity is a superpower.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It’s what gives you an edge that lasts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Why?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because anyone can learn what to do, and (especially in the vibe coding genAI era), how to do it.Those who succeed understand why it works, how it connects to the broader picture, and what happens next.&amp;ldquo;They connect the dots between business, technology, and human behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>These thoughts from Sam have resonated with me ...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-08-28-these-thoughts-from-sam-have-resonated-with-me/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2025 11:27:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-08-28-these-thoughts-from-sam-have-resonated-with-me/</guid><description>&lt;p>These thoughts from Sam have resonated with me - especially the bit about the uncertain world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s a problem I&amp;rsquo;m loving to learn more about with Worksome (and hopefully contribute to a solution and new ways of working).We completely divide the workforce in &amp;ldquo;temporary&amp;rdquo; (contingent, freelancer, etc) workers and &amp;ldquo;permanent&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there&amp;rsquo;s nothing permanent!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The current global landscape is fully &amp;ldquo;VUCA&amp;rdquo; (Volatile, Uncertain, Complex and Ambiguous) - there&amp;rsquo;s no certainty - so nothing &amp;ldquo;permanent&amp;rdquo;.When the hiring process is only catered for the &amp;ldquo;perm positions&amp;rdquo;, with all the due diligence in place, and a broken hiring marketplace (companies want to hire and don&amp;rsquo;t find talent, talent can&amp;rsquo;t find the opportunities), you just end slowing down your business, and the hires will join you systematically delayed (when the opportunity might have died already).Having the power of hiring on demand, when it&amp;rsquo;s needed and for what people are best for is a superpower to adapt to the current landscape and take advantage of opportunity as it comes - instead of delaying it until the budget allows for a FTE to join, there&amp;rsquo;s a candidate pool built, hiring process has gone through end to end&amp;hellip; A constantly changing world requires an adaptable and flexible way of working.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>🚨 Two months in at Worksome, first job alert 🎉</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-08-27-two-months-in-at-worksome-first-job-alert/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Aug 2025 14:44:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-08-27-two-months-in-at-worksome-first-job-alert/</guid><description>&lt;p>🚨 Two months in at Worksome, first job alert 🎉&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Time flies (when you&amp;rsquo;re having fun), and it&amp;rsquo;s about to be two months here. I&amp;rsquo;m (especially) excited as we have the first job opening in my team, working directly with the great Lucas &amp;amp; his team, to work from the (greatly located office) in Copenhagen.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;We have a strong focus on the Laravel ecosystem (and Vue in the frontend), but the most important aspect is that we are a truly flat team, where engineering has a significant say in how we build our product. That makes the job ideal for someone who wants to develop a digital product and solve customer problems (using technology, of course). &amp;quot;

&lt;p>We had spoken years ago - and while the timing wasn&amp;rsquo;t quite right and stayed at SumUp for a bit longer (learning and growing a lot!), I kept an eye on the company trajectory 👀Worksome isn’t just transforming how businesses access global talent; they’re redefining work culture itself.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Worksome</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/experience/worksome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/experience/worksome/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="joined-a-danish-startup-revolutionizing-the-future-of-work">Joined a Danish startup revolutionizing the future of work&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>This one looks like it could work&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and ended with my longest tenure. I came with curiosity about fintech and how a company could make money from card payments - leave wiser (also with more gray hair, one must confess) - things like card exchanges, regulated products, and international launches feel natural now 🌍Looking back, I am extremely grateful.⚡️ For every leader who saw sparks in me before I did and gave me a chance.&amp;quot;🌱 For every sumupper who shared feedback with me or found my input useful for their personal growth.&amp;quot;🚀 For every teammate who turned chaos into &amp;ldquo;holy shit, we shipped that.📣 For everyone who bore with my (endless) questions during incidents (&amp;ldquo;should we update the status page?!&amp;rdquo;)&amp;quot;🕴 For every merchant I’ve ambushed with &amp;ldquo;Psst… what fees are you paying?&amp;rdquo; (#ICanOfferABetterCardReader forever ).SumUp has been a place where I truly felt I belonged and has exceeded my expectations of what I could achieve, thanks to the enabling culture embedded in our values.

&lt;p>It could be a useful way to network at events, which won&amp;rsquo;t include LinkedIn (they use the QR code to link to your profile).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Great day of AI talks organized by IDA, in thei...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-21-great-day-of-ai-talks-organized-by-ida-in-thei/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 May 2025 05:08:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-21-great-day-of-ai-talks-organized-by-ida-in-thei/</guid><description>&lt;p>Great day of AI talks organized by IDA, in their yearly &amp;ldquo;Driving AI&amp;rdquo; event.&amp;ldquo;It was really inspiring to see real-world usage of (gen)AI in different environments such as energy trading (Casper Kaae Sønderby from twig.energy), e-commerce recommendations (Mathias Grønne from Roccai), with the combination of more &amp;ldquo;philosophical&amp;rdquo; topics like what are agents, or how to orchestrate agents in a multi-agent environment.The closing speech from Jacob Sherson resonated strongly with me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Today, in "vibe coding adventures": I've direct...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-19-today-in-vibe-coding-adventures-ive-direct/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 May 2025 19:45:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-19-today-in-vibe-coding-adventures-ive-direct/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today, in &amp;ldquo;vibe coding adventures&amp;rdquo;: I&amp;rsquo;ve directed Manus AI to:1. propose improvements to my website (adrianmoreno.info), without more instruction - to see where it would focus&amp;quot;2. understand that the code of my website is open source - but split in two repositories (theme and content)&amp;ldquo;3. implement the theme fixes in a way that are usable for anyone using the themeThe challenges faced were quite interesting.&amp;ldquo;Manus could do a lot of the operations with github via API, but initially it refused and wanted me to copy/paste the code changes.&amp;ldquo;Same with the improvements: initially it would propose changes that broke the theme.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Vibe coding has made programming fun for me aga...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-07-vibe-coding-has-made-programming-fun-for-me-aga/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 May 2025 19:25:38 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-07-vibe-coding-has-made-programming-fun-for-me-aga/</guid><description>&lt;p>Vibe coding has made programming fun for me again 🔮, and reconnected me with the eagerness to create.My sabbatical at SumUp started on January this year, which means that around Christmas time, I got myself an &amp;ldquo;assignment&amp;rdquo; to play with some of the coding assistants (Copilot and Cursor mainly).I took the chance to make some improvements on my website template (&lt;a href="https://lnkd.in/dPz6DUS6)">https://lnkd.in/dPz6DUS6)&lt;/a>, which is the open-source theme behind my own site (&lt;a href="https://lnkd.in/dTv6XuT)">https://lnkd.in/dTv6XuT)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>We've all been there: you want to communicate e...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-04-01-weve-all-been-there-you-want-to-communicate-e/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Apr 2025 07:54:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-04-01-weve-all-been-there-you-want-to-communicate-e/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve all been there: you want to communicate effectively and use some obvious and harmless acronyms.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Each chapter explores cognitive biases that are so fascinating and applicable to business and daily life that Kahneman could have expanded any single one into the book.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not just a book you read—it&amp;rsquo;s one you revisit, each time discovering insights you somehow missed before.Daniel Kahneman&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece fundamentally changed how I understand decision-making—both my own and within the teams I work with.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>People, your "engagement AI automations" are ge...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-03-10-people-your-engagement-ai-automations-are-ge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 15:43:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-03-10-people-your-engagement-ai-automations-are-ge/</guid><description>&lt;p>People, your &amp;ldquo;engagement AI automations&amp;rdquo; are getting out of hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;increasing engagement and visibility&amp;rdquo; of your brand, but giving a shit first impression.As with anything computer-generated, you need to supervise what these random tools do in your behalf, such as:🤦‍♂️ useless comments: &amp;ldquo;What a great summary of news, thanks for sharing&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cool AI - that&amp;rsquo;s what reactions are for&amp;quot;😵‍💫 completely out of context comments: (in a piece of news) &amp;ldquo;Please &lt;Name> connect with me and we can discuss the background of the position&amp;rdquo;.

Management is. 🧭</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-02-27-leadership-isnt-a-job-title-management-is/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Feb 2025 09:01:30 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-02-27-leadership-isnt-a-job-title-management-is/</guid><description>&lt;p>Leadership isn’t a job title. Management is. 🧭&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Let’s clear something up: Leadership and management get mixed around like synonyms, but they’re different concepts. Sometimes they overlap, but they&amp;rsquo;re not the same.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Here’s the thing:&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;✅ Anyone can lead – Influence, inspire, take ownership. That’s leadership.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;✅ Managers manage – Hire, budget, execute. That’s a specific job.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;But here’s the trap: When we act like “leadership” is code for “managers only,” we tell the rest of the team: “Your voice doesn’t matter; leave this to us.”&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Worse? We end up with managers who manage processes but don’t lead people. And teams waiting for permission instead of stepping up.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;📚 A book that puts this greatly is &amp;ldquo;Turn the ship around!&amp;rdquo;, by L. David Marquet. A submarine captain flipped the script on the traditional “leader-follower” model—where only the person at the top “leads”—and instead built a “leader-leader” culture. His secret? Leadership wasn’t about authority. It was about empowering everyone to make decisions, regardless of rank. The result? A crew that didn’t just follow orders… they owned outcomes.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Next time you hear, &amp;ldquo;I would like a leadership position, but I have no team to manage 🙁&amp;rdquo; remember this vital difference and encourage anyone to lead from wherever they are. &amp;quot;
&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;Leadership isn’t reserved or limited. It should be spread and encouraged to grow anywhere in your teams 💪. As leaders, we must make sure that everyone at the &amp;ldquo;edges of the organization&amp;rdquo; has the right context to keep alignment with the shared goals and mission, and information to decide by themselves.&amp;rdquo;

&lt;p>Something I&amp;rsquo;ve given some thought is precisely on being away.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>But we have mirrors, can see our webcam while in the meeting and can adjust quickly.⏺️ Do yourself a favor: record yourself speaking for some seconds in a tool like &lt;a href="https://lnkd.in/dxNfKFAv">https://lnkd.in/dxNfKFAv&lt;/a>, check how you sound with different microphones,and choose accordingly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Test different situations, such as noises in the background, walking around, or being on the go.Don&amp;rsquo;t assume that because you hear others well, the opposite will be true. I would bet that most that read this will have a headset or headphones that are way better at playing audio than recording it (I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of good consumer-grade headphones, that are not thought or designed for office or transmitting audio).Having others have to second guess what you said or being distracted by background sounds will definitely hurt how what you say is perceived.In the comments I leave some specific tips on hardware that will improve your online presence (spoiler: it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be expensive).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SumUp's Hackweek 2024 is a wrap - and what a bl...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-09-15-sumups-hackweek-2024-is-a-wrap-and-what-a-bl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2024 14:06:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-09-15-sumups-hackweek-2024-is-a-wrap-and-what-a-bl/</guid><description>&lt;p>SumUp&amp;rsquo;s Hackweek 2024 is a wrap - and what a blast it was! 🤩.

&lt;p>🪟The broken windows theory states that visible signs of crime or antisocial behavior encourage further crimes - leading to an escalation in violence. The same thing can happen in a workplace when small things are observed that do not work as they should, and no one does anything to fix or prevent them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Never make fun of someone who mispronounces a w...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-07-26-never-make-fun-of-someone-who-mispronounces-a-w/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jul 2024 12:33:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-07-26-never-make-fun-of-someone-who-mispronounces-a-w/</guid><description>&lt;p>Never make fun of someone who mispronounces a word - it means they learned it by reading.I can&amp;rsquo;t find whom to attribute this quote to, but think of this when working with people with a different pronunciation than you.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>&lt;em>Making explicit the implicit&lt;/em> might be my most repeated mantra when working with software development teams - or product development by extension.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When working in a technological context, with interrelated products, you are constantly faced with complex and ambiguous problems that require creative and innovative solutions. You have to make decisions based on incomplete or conflicting information, and communicate them effectively to your team and stakeholders. You also have to deal with the human and emotional aspects of leading people, such as motivating, coaching, and resolving conflicts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New office home!</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-01-new-office-home/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 16:57:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-01-new-office-home/</guid><description>&lt;p>New office home!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>When people look up to you, you need to consider the incentives you set. Incentives are not just about giving rewards or punishments, but also about making sure your team members share the same goals, values and behaviors as your organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Incentives can make a big difference in how your organization works, and how people work together, talk to each other and come up with new ideas&lt;/strong>.

&lt;p>For one full week, the members of the Engineering, Product and Design teams of SumUp gathered together again, in person, to experiment and create together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>🇧🇬 This year we met in Bulgaria (where we have a great office in Sofia), next to the Black Sea. For five full days, the sole goal of the week is to self-organize in problems we want to solve, iterate - and even ship it to production! 🚀&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Really looking forward to this! 🥳</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-09-09-really-looking-forward-to-this/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Sep 2023 11:16:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-09-09-really-looking-forward-to-this/</guid><description>&lt;p>Really looking forward to this! 🥳&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a world of working through online tools - I especially enjoy the moment of complicity of working on something together sharing a desk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Organic conversations without having to raise a hand or check who was next at the queue - only to get a drink with a colleague after a good day of hacking together! 🍻&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Can&amp;rsquo;t wait to meet so many people i mostly speak with through slack in person - and see what we create together! 🦾&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hey, vrienden in Nederland 🇳🇱 - if you want to ...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-08-22-hey-vrienden-in-nederland-if-you-want-to/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Aug 2023 20:23:58 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-08-22-hey-vrienden-in-nederland-if-you-want-to/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey, vrienden in Nederland 🇳🇱 - if you want to try something that feels like the future give this a try.&amp;ldquo;Convince your favorite biertje, biterballen or kaastengel dealer to give it a try (or get a SumUp account to try - you only pay a % on transaction fee), and feel the magic of paying directly on the phone ✨(ok, other merchant kinds will also be welcome to try - but those are still some of my favourite words and Dutch snacks, I had to find a excuse to drop them)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Here we go, to a new country 🇦🇺🦘!</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-08-16-here-we-go-to-a-new-country-now-were-pres/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2023 08:13:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-08-16-here-we-go-to-a-new-country-now-were-pres/</guid><description>&lt;p>Here we go, to a new country 🇦🇺🦘!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I often get asked what skills are most useful to develop to be a successful leader. I want to make a case for making &lt;strong>empathy&lt;/strong> a top tool in our skillset.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Empathy is the ability to &lt;em>detect and understand other people’s feelings&lt;/em>. It’s a skill that we can all improve through training and practice. Empathy is not only good for our personal relationships but also for our professional ones. It can help us reduce stress, build more positive relationships, and even boost revenues.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I met Zahra during the React meetup we hosted i...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-05-04-i-met-zahra-during-the-react-meetup-we-hosted-i/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 May 2023 12:48:42 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-05-04-i-met-zahra-during-the-react-meetup-we-hosted-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>I met Zahra during the React meetup we hosted in SumUp Copenhagen.

&lt;p>Playful joking increases the likelihood of financial concessions during a negotiation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Small wonder that playfulness holds a prominent place in the tool kit of emotionally intelligent leaders.I love to love what I do, and part of it is having fun (poor Anna had to witness it &lt;a href="https://lnkd.in/gNjfYWJW">https://lnkd.in/gNjfYWJW&lt;/a> 😆).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>👏 breaking sterotypes, one business at a time!</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-03-08-breaking-sterotypes-one-business-at-a-time/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Mar 2023 14:30:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-03-08-breaking-sterotypes-one-business-at-a-time/</guid><description>&lt;p>👏 breaking sterotypes, one business at a time!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>If I wouldn't already be working with Jan (alth...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-03-05-if-i-wouldnt-already-be-working-with-jan-alth/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2023 17:12:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-03-05-if-i-wouldnt-already-be-working-with-jan-alth/</guid><description>&lt;p>If I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t already be working with Jan (although from another team), I would apply right away!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>As a manager, it&amp;rsquo;s easy to rely on your team to tell how things are working, and gradually lose contact with the process on itself. The problems they face, the challenges they solve, the issues they experience in their day to day - will flow through your interactions with them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But there&amp;rsquo;s no replacement for seeing it with your own eyes, and understanding it by yourself, from first-party data. The practice of &amp;ldquo;Genchi Genbutsu&amp;rdquo; comes from the Toyota Production System, and it&amp;rsquo;s not meant to &amp;ldquo;physically observe everything&amp;rdquo;, but more as gathering data by yourself, and &amp;ldquo;cutting the middleman&amp;rdquo; when doing observations about how things are running.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists.

&lt;p>It is great to be in contact with our merchants, understanding them and learning from their entrepreneurial stories.We do that in multiple ways: by talking to merchants on their businesses, feedback that is provided to us to improve our products - or interviews where we can dive deeper into how they use our technology, what they like about it and what we can do better.In the photo you can see the team in our Invoices tribe paying lots of attention to one of our merchant interview sessions, greatly lead by Neža being &amp;ldquo;our voice&amp;rdquo; with the merchant.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This weekend I've got to play with Midjourney's...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-27-this-weekend-ive-got-to-play-with-midjourneys/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Nov 2022 17:33:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-27-this-weekend-ive-got-to-play-with-midjourneys/</guid><description>&lt;p>This weekend I&amp;rsquo;ve got to play with Midjourney&amp;rsquo;s last version, v4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The improvements are amazing 🤯, generating images on the text inputs (or &amp;ldquo;prompts&amp;rdquo;) provided to the system.What fascinates me the most is the usability of the system itself.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Talking about using a bleeding edge AI/ML system would usually require some deep technical expertise, dedicated last-generation hardware&amp;hellip; but that&amp;rsquo;s not the case with Midjourney v4.Using it is as simple as interacting with the typical customer-support chatbot that helps you find a missing e-commerce order: you install Discord, join the beta (&lt;a href="https://lnkd.in/ezMdB9Gw)">https://lnkd.in/ezMdB9Gw)&lt;/a>, send your prompt with a command (&amp;quot;/imagine &amp;hellip;&amp;quot;), and you&amp;rsquo;re in.The bot will use the servers to generate 4 images, that once received can be upscaled, remixed to iterate on some of them - and that&amp;rsquo;s it!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being able to define something makes conversati...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-20-being-able-to-define-something-makes-conversati/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2022 17:43:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-20-being-able-to-define-something-makes-conversati/</guid><description>&lt;p>Being able to define something makes conversations way more engaging and deep than when you&amp;rsquo;re trying to figure out how to call things&amp;hellip; 🙊 Let me elaborate on the idea💡 and bring a practical example + a book recommendation (combo!).This lies behind the linguistic relativity hypothesis &amp;ndash; that explores if language influences the way that we think.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You need to build that trust by showing that you care for the person, and genuinely want to help them by providing it.When the only feedback that you give is &amp;ldquo;corrective&amp;rdquo; (aka negative), you&amp;rsquo;re giving a similar vibe to the person.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'd rather interact with more "current-X" peopl...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-04-10-id-rather-interact-with-more-current-x-peopl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 16:45:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-04-10-id-rather-interact-with-more-current-x-peopl/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d rather interact with more &amp;ldquo;current-X&amp;rdquo; people than &amp;ldquo;ex-Y&amp;rdquo; 🧐Let me extend on this thought.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The space that we have for bios, for introductions and to cause first impressions is limited. I assume that by editing the default &amp;ldquo;Role at Company&amp;rdquo; headline that LinkedIn generates, you have put some thought on it.If the best way that you have to show who you are is to highlight that you worked at a specific company - the first impression that I get is a shallow, with a touch of elitism. &amp;ldquo;I find an implicit message of &amp;ldquo;I worked at companyX, so I was good&amp;rdquo;, but the way it comes across to me is as a way to try to impress others based on association, instead on qualities or credentials. I care more of who you are, what you learned and how you treat others than were you studied or worked before. I hope that there&amp;rsquo;s something else that can define you than were you worked before.And past successes don&amp;rsquo;t grant future ones, so you better be adaptable and not be defined by the past!Signed:&amp;ldquo;Adrián Moreno Peña, ex-traordinary dad joke maker, ex-cellent colleague and sometimes ex-aggerating writer, for the purpose of making my rants more enterntaining&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tech Leaders Journal: How to balance independence and control within your organization</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/public-speaking/2022-03-17-tech-leaders-hub-independence-control/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/public-speaking/2022-03-17-tech-leaders-hub-independence-control/</guid><description>&lt;p>Unlock the secrets to striking the perfect balance between independence and control within your organization with Adrián Moreno Peña, Director of Engineering at SumUp, in this episode of Tech Leaders Hub.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Luckily in tech we&amp;rsquo;ve been able to adapt quite quickly and efficiently to this new &amp;ldquo;work from home&amp;rdquo; as default - but that has come with quite a toll on how we interact with each other, the boundaries between work and time off, and the possibility of disconnecting from work.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This year I culminated a process in which I hav...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-21-this-year-i-culminated-a-process-in-which-i-hav/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 20:46:08 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-21-this-year-i-culminated-a-process-in-which-i-hav/</guid><description>&lt;p>This year I culminated a process in which I have invested more than at many of the jobs or education I&amp;rsquo;ve had.

&lt;p>The year is 2015. I see myself on a pic in the company slack and think &amp;ldquo;how unflattering it is&amp;rdquo;. I had moved to Amsterdam and lost my exercise routine, consisting in playing football with my friends at the local league.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But I had to accept it: the pic was not unflattering - I came to terms with it and started running, because it was very convenient: no gym subscription, no schedules, and could go out any time. Only one downside: I &lt;strong>hated&lt;/strong> it. It was the part I disliked the most of football training - but somehow I convinced myself &amp;ldquo;endure, focus on smaller objectives and just do it&amp;rdquo;. So I&amp;rsquo;d focus on getting to the next street light, to the next crossing - and celebrate small achievements: &amp;ldquo;today I ran 1km without stopping&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;my longest run of 5km!&amp;rdquo;, and so on.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Remember to tell your colleagues that you appre...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-02-remember-to-tell-your-colleagues-that-you-appre/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 19:03:27 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-12-02-remember-to-tell-your-colleagues-that-you-appre/</guid><description>&lt;p>Remember to tell your colleagues that you appreciate them.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>At SumUp I got hands-on with a more complex organizational setup and map, with a tribalized setup; and highly enjoyed the reflective &lt;a href="https://www.sumup.com/en-us/wtf-sumup-organisation/">spirit of the company when finding new ways of working&lt;/a>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>After 1 year and a half my relationship with Va...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-04-28-after-1-year-and-a-half-my-relationship-with-va/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Apr 2021 12:08:22 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-04-28-after-1-year-and-a-half-my-relationship-with-va/</guid><description>&lt;p>After 1 year and a half my relationship with VanMoof changes: from Tech Lead to Brand Ambassador 🚲 (in other words, I&amp;rsquo;m leaving the company ;-)It has been intense, with funding rounds, new product launches (S3/X3, powerbank), trail-blazing features (Find My network support 🍏)&amp;hellip; and a lot of fun on the go.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And all this during a worldwide pandemic and an explosion on bike demand 🤯I started with a focus on the digital ecosystem, improving the tech foundation (monitoring, infrastructure, SLAs, providers, etc) and boy, we&amp;rsquo;ve come a long way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>This is why you cannot have a team of only supe...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-04-19-this-is-why-you-cannot-have-a-team-of-only-supe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Apr 2021 09:09:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2021-04-19-this-is-why-you-cannot-have-a-team-of-only-supe/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is why you cannot have a team of only super stars - you end in an ego-fight, a self-driven escalation where the team and personal objectives drift apart.Somebody needs to be willing to do the dirty work and &amp;ldquo;take one for the team&amp;rdquo;!As a manager it&amp;rsquo;s important to acknowledge and recognise the performers that keep a team together.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>VanMoof is a developer and designer of urban e-bikes, with a Direct-to-consumer model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With retail locations in Tokyo, Berlin, San Francisco, London, Paris, Taipei - I joined in the moment that the company started to shape as a scale-up - joining just before the &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/12/vanmoof-raises-13-5m-to-capitalize-on-e-bike-boom-in-wake-of-covid-19/">Series-A ($13.5M)&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/after-lockdowns-lead-to-an-e-bike-boom-vanmoof-raises-40m-series-b-to-expand-globally/">B ($40M)&lt;/a> investment rounds.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During my work at VanMoof I participated in in-sourcing efforts, to bring technology closer to the core of the company, especially in the digital ecosystem (which included the content and marketing sites, e-commerce systems, ERP, customer support, and other custom-developed solutions both for internal and customer use).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>When working in a remote environment it's so ea...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2019-04-28-when-working-in-a-remote-environment-its-so-ea/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Apr 2019 20:28:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2019-04-28-when-working-in-a-remote-environment-its-so-ea/</guid><description>&lt;p>When working in a remote environment it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to fall into the trap of monotony and sticking to remote presence only for the minimal interaction required to get the work done.But appreciating your colleagues, having fun and trying to elevate the remote meetings from what they tend to be (the lowest common denominator that just lets things get done) should be normal, to be able to collaborate remotely as satisfying as doing it in person.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>As in many other cities, housing in Amsterdam i...</title><link>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2019-03-16-as-in-many-other-cities-housing-in-amsterdam-i/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Mar 2019 19:33:26 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2019-03-16-as-in-many-other-cities-housing-in-amsterdam-i/</guid><description>&lt;p>As in many other cities, housing in Amsterdam is in a complicated situation - with a city that is very interesting to live in and people moving, it puts pressure on the housing market.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The title was &amp;ldquo;How to Become a Good Tech Lead&amp;rdquo; and it was lead with the questions of the attendants, covering common doubts such as how to organize the teams at the company, how to align a non-tech company towards an agile approach, how they deal with bad colleagues or toxic employees and how to reward the good ones, or what technical leadership means to them.Something that I didn&amp;rsquo;t find so mature is that the reaction we (as tech-involved audience and panellists) have to a question about how to manage stress and burnouts: we laugh. I think that&amp;rsquo;s not taken too seriously, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to fall into the trap of idealizing long hours, just because we like what we do.The way I see it, work and life need to be balanced to be a successful person that is able to work and for that, the company needs to give you support to achieve it, but it also starts by taking one&amp;rsquo;s mental health seriously.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Come and be my tech buddy!

&lt;p>Emakina.NL is a digital agency with a strong focus in e-commerce and enterprise content management systems. Emakina.NL is a strategic solution partner for Salesforce Commerce Cloud (&lt;a href="https://blog.emakina.com/2017/06/20/emakina-salesforce-commerce-cloud-partner/)">https://blog.emakina.com/2017/06/20/emakina-salesforce-commerce-cloud-partner/)&lt;/a>, and has also experience in cross-cloud solutions across the Salesforce ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Emakina.NL I was part of a multidisciplinar agile team, with a cross-functional combination of roles from different providers, and the client, working together. The technical team was up to 10 people, but it was only a part of the whole - which included a dedicated QA engineering team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Business Analysts.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Yes, you're an imposter.

&lt;p>After an evaluation of potential locations where to relocate to, I chose Amsterdam as a city, and The Mobile Company as my company.

 &lt;h1>Who am I?&lt;/h1>
 &lt;div class="about-me content lead">
 &lt;p class='lead'>An engineer at heart and a problem-solver by nature, I channel curiosity and energy into creating technology that simplifies lives. Leadership, for me, means rolling up my sleeves: you'll find me debugging code with engineers one hour and aligning product strategy the next. I'm a &lt;strong>deliberate generalist&lt;/strong>, a T-shaped professional with a hybrid toolkit: part technical architect, part team builder. After founding a startup, I learned to bridge business vision and technical execution—scaling systems, mentoring teams, and advocating for user-centric design. My leadership thrives on three principles: &lt;ol>&lt;li>&lt;strong>Iterative Improvement:&lt;/strong> I foster teams that treat progress as a cycle of experimentation, feedback, and refinement.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;strong>Radical Transparency:&lt;/strong> From blocks to wins, I believe open communication builds trust and aligns goals.&lt;/li>&lt;li>&lt;strong>Empathy as a Superpower:&lt;/strong> Understanding diverse perspectives—whether engineers, clients, or end-users—fuels better decisions and stronger collaboration.&lt;/li>&lt;/ol>&lt;br/>&lt;strong>My superpower?&lt;/strong> Versatility. From architecting backend systems (Node.js, Java or PHP) or mobile apps, to optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I connect dots across disciplines to build products that resonate. But technology alone isn't the answer: I obsess over &lt;em>how&lt;/em> teams work, fostering environments where psychological safety and iterative learning drive innovation.
 &lt;/div>

 Joined a Danish startup revolutionizing the future of work In July 2025, I joined Worksome, a Danish startup focused on transforming how companies and freelancers connect and work together. Based in Copenhagen, Worksome is building innovative solutions for the modern workforce, creating a platform that streamlines the process of finding, hiring, and managing freelance talent.
At Worksome, I&amp;rsquo;m leveraging my experience in engineering leadership to help scale the technology organization and drive product innovation. Working in a fast-paced startup environment allows me to contribute to both strategic direction and hands-on implementation of key initiatives.
The role combines my passion for building high-performing engineering teams with the opportunity to shape the future of work in an increasingly freelance-oriented global economy.

 &lt;h1>VP of Engineering &amp;amp; Tribe Lead - SumUp&lt;/h1>
 Moved to Denmark, joined an European Unicorn 🦄 After relocating from Amsterdam to Copenhagen - I joined SumUp to work in the danish headquarters as an Engineering Manager for the Accounting Squad, in the Merchant Growth Tribe. The team I joined had been part of a previous acquisition of SumUp (Debitoor): merging cultures and integrating into the overall company was a big challenge.
At SumUp I got hands-on with a more complex organizational setup and map, with a tribalized setup; and highly enjoyed the reflective spirit of the company when finding new ways of working.
Later, I got promoted to Director of Engineering, overseeing the engineering department of the Invoices Tribe (and its two products, SumUp Invoices &amp;amp; Accounting). As part of the Tribe leadership, I worked on aligning technology and product to ensure a solid foundation for quick iterations, and maximising merchants&amp;rsquo; value and developer experience (happy teams = happy product = happy customers!).
Afterwards, I got another job change, transitioning to be the tribe lead for the Invoices &amp;amp; Accounting team. This role involves P&amp;amp;L responsibility, as well as accountability on financial results and product evolution.
The team size is around 30 FTE - organized in 4 squads + QA, each with an Engineering Manager. We provide mobile app services (from the context of the SumUp SuperApp) as well as web experience.
Additionally, I expanded my scope on Engineering, by driving the global Incident Response process. Without direct reports, the responsibility includes to lead the implementation of the processes and tools. The role involves intense collaboration with other functions (such as Risk, Compliance and Operations) to implement the process in a holistic, customer-centric manner.
After being focused on growth, aligned with the global economical context in 2023 there was a strong company-wide pivot to profitability. This resulted on achieving a funding round of €285 million in december, fueling the growth ambition (with a economically sustainable approach).

 &lt;h1>Tech Lead - VanMoof&lt;/h1>
 Startup-life VanMoof is a developer and designer of urban e-bikes, with a Direct-to-consumer model.
With retail locations in Tokyo, Berlin, San Francisco, London, Paris, Taipei - I joined in the moment that the company started to shape as a scale-up - joining just before the Series-A ($13.5M) and B ($40M) investment rounds.
During my work at VanMoof I participated in in-sourcing efforts, to bring technology closer to the core of the company, especially in the digital ecosystem (which included the content and marketing sites, e-commerce systems, ERP, customer support, and other custom-developed solutions both for internal and customer use).
The team grew fast while I worked at VanMoof. In the early stage I worked as Tech Lead, focusing in an Individual Contributor track mixed with technical leadership, and participated in in-sourcing the development of the platform and setting up fundaments like continous integration, pull request review processes, or infrastructure as code and 24x7 service. As the team scaled up in the hypergrowth phase, I participated in the organization of the teams, shaping my role as an Engineering Manager, and setting new disciplines (such as QA department, frontend-development), new platforms (such as the definition and launch of the partner network, shaping the collaboration with the development partners Info.nl).

 &lt;h1>Technical Lead - Emakina.NL&lt;/h1>
 Agency-life Emakina.NL is a digital agency with a strong focus in e-commerce and enterprise content management systems. Emakina.NL is a strategic solution partner for Salesforce Commerce Cloud (https://blog.emakina.com/2017/06/20/emakina-salesforce-commerce-cloud-partner/), and has also experience in cross-cloud solutions across the Salesforce ecosystem.
In Emakina.NL I was part of a multidisciplinar agile team, with a cross-functional combination of roles from different providers, and the client, working together. The technical team was up to 10 people, but it was only a part of the whole - which included a dedicated QA engineering team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Business Analysts.
The solution I worked on for 2 years was a cross-cloud implementation in SFCC, with a tech stack strongly oriented towards the Salesforce ecosystem: Javascript in the backend and frontend, SASS, Mulesoft &amp;amp; Java as middleware, Azure as the cloud infrastructure, and the Atlassian ecosystem (JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo) for the day to to day.
My role as tech lead was to provide solutions that would fit in the technical and functional landscape, ensuring maintainability, quality and the right knowledge distribution in the team. For this, the role included coaching new team members, hands-on (pair) programming, and intensive code review to ensure the highest standards and continuous improvement. It also involved the creation of plannings and estimations, and definitions of roadmaps.
As a side track at Emakina.NL I also participated in some public speaking sessions, internally and also externally:
Web Accessibility Live 2018, organised by SiteImprove in Amsterdam: https://siteimprove.com/nl-nl/events/web-accessibility-live-2018/, with a talk about the technical implementation of the accessibility requirements in a e-commerce project. Continuous Delivery Amsterdam, https://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Delivery-Amsterdam/events/247988829/, with a talk about CD/CI in Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

 &lt;h1>CTO - Pocket Media&lt;/h1>
 First time leading a multi-cultural team At Pocket Media I lead the tech team of the company, in a process of product creation and launch to market. I was a member of the management team of the company, and lead up to 10 FTE, in charge of hiring, role definition, and performance management.
As part of my (team) tasks, I executed mobile and web (high scalability) development projects. I defined the products roadmap, milestones, and plans to achieve the objectives, as well as the talent acquisition.
The company focus as an advertisement agency was strongly towards app installs and mobile entertainment, and the product definition spiralled around those verticals. The focus of the native advertisement platform we developed was in customisability, ease to adopt by mobile and web developers and media, and transparency towards the partners.

 First job abroad By 2015 I was looking for a life change - and this was accompanied by a professional &amp;ldquo;reinvention&amp;rdquo;. After years growing Zadia together with my co-founder and partner, I exited the venture with the aim of starting afresh in a new location, new culture, and discover new ways of working.
After an evaluation of potential locations where to relocate to, I chose Amsterdam as a city, and The Mobile Company as my company. There I worked with an excellent group of professionals, highly specialised in native, high quality mobile application development for some of the largest apps in the Netherlands.
At TMC I developed innovative new apps (ie: using Bluetooth BLE beacons technology, which in 2015 was an emerging technology) and also maintained apps with a large and complex codebase and numerous users, among top Dutch apps. I helped tackling complex problems and long-standing bugs, and participated in an agile teams that included the client.
