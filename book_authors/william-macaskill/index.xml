It covers a wide range of topics, including global poverty, the environment, artificial intelligence, and existential risks. MacAskill presents an interesting examination of the moral challenges that we face as a society and the choices that we must make in order to create a better future. He argues that we have a moral obligation to consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to take steps to ensure that the future is as good as it can be.</description></item></channel></rss>
