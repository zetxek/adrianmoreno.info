The authors identify four main team topologies – hub-and-spoke, matrix, marketplace, and federated – and provide guidance on how to choose the right one for a given context. They also discuss the challenges and benefits of each topology and provide practical strategies for implementing and managing them. The book is aimed at software development managers and leaders looking to build and lead high-performing teams; and has very useful diagrams to map your team topologies.
I like it because it gives very useful vocabulary and visualization to how to setup a company organization - so it facilitates the dialog with other groups.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
