The book argues that the ability to do deep work – defined as the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task – is becoming increasingly rare and valuable in today&amp;rsquo;s economy. The book offers practical strategies and tips for cultivating the ability to do deep work, including how to establish clear goals and priorities, how to eliminate distractions, and how to build habits that support deep work.</description></item></channel></rss>
