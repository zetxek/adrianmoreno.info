IT identifies eight scales on which cultures differ – communication, evaluation, trust, leadership, decision-making, communication style, time, and relationship-building – and provides practical strategies for navigating these differences in order to build strong, effective relationships with people from different cultural backgrounds. The book is based on the idea that cultural differences can be a source of strength and creativity, but they must be understood and managed effectively in order to unlock their full potential.</description></item></channel></rss>
