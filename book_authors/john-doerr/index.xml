Reading the book from John Doerr, it&amp;rsquo;s creator - helped me get a more clear background on the intention of the framework, and how good and bad OKR&amp;rsquo;s look like. It has some quite useful and relatable examples, and while thee framework itself is not a silver bullet, there are many good parts that can be taken - especially as a tool to reflect on big goals that will push you forward, and how to &amp;ldquo;divide and conquer&amp;rdquo; a large objective.</description></item></channel></rss>
