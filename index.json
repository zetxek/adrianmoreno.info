Engineering Leader Based in Copenhagen üá©üá∞, I work at Worksome, a Danish company redefining how businesses and independent professionals collaborate. Our mission is to enable frictionless, compliant, and global access to top talent‚Äîempowering companies to adapt to the future of work. A specialized generalist at heart, I bring a unique blend of expertise across backend systems, mobile development, and infrastructure. Over my career, I've led teams of all sizes‚Äîfrom hands-on coding to scaling engineering organizations‚Äîalways grounded in the 3P framework: People, Product, Process.I'm passionate about building high-performing teams rooted in psychological safety, continuous learning, and meaningful impact. Whether it's refining delivery practices or mentoring future leaders, I focus on shaping environments where both products and people thrive. Contact me Who am I? An engineer at heart and a problem-solver by nature, I channel curiosity and energy into creating technology that simplifies lives. Leadership, for me, means rolling up my sleeves: you'll find me debugging code with engineers one hour and aligning product strategy the next. I'm a deliberate generalist, a T-shaped professional with a hybrid toolkit: part technical architect, part team builder. After founding a startup, I learned to bridge business vision and technical execution‚Äîscaling systems, mentoring teams, and advocating for user-centric design. My leadership thrives on three principles: Iterative Improvement: I foster teams that treat progress as a cycle of experimentation, feedback, and refinement.Radical Transparency: From blocks to wins, I believe open communication builds trust and aligns goals.Empathy as a Superpower: Understanding diverse perspectives‚Äîwhether engineers, clients, or end-users‚Äîfuels better decisions and stronger collaboration.My superpower? Versatility. From architecting backend systems (Node.js, Java or PHP) or mobile apps, to optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I connect dots across disciplines to build products that resonate. But technology alone isn't the answer: I obsess over how teams work, fostering environments where psychological safety and iterative learning drive innovation.

At Worksome, I\u0026rsquo;m leveraging my experience in engineering leadership to help scale the technology organization and drive product innovation. Working in a fast-paced startup environment allows me to contribute to both strategic direction and hands-on implementation of key initiatives. The role combines my passion for building high-performing engineering teams with the opportunity to shape the future of work in an increasingly freelance-oriented global economy. 2021-2025 Engineering Manager ‚Üí VP of Engineering \u0026amp; Tribe Lead SumUp. Copenhagen, Denmark VP of Engineering \u0026amp; Tribe Lead - SumUp Moved to Denmark, joined an European Unicorn ü¶Ñ After relocating from Amsterdam to Copenhagen - I joined SumUp to work in the danish headquarters as an Engineering Manager for the Accounting Squad, in the Merchant Growth Tribe. The team I joined had been part of a previous acquisition of SumUp (Debitoor): merging cultures and integrating into the overall company was a big challenge. At SumUp I got hands-on with a more complex organizational setup and map, with a tribalized setup; and highly enjoyed the reflective spirit of the company when finding new ways of working. Later, I got promoted to Director of Engineering, overseeing the engineering department of the Invoices Tribe (and its two products, SumUp Invoices \u0026amp; Accounting). As part of the Tribe leadership, I worked on aligning technology and product to ensure a solid foundation for quick iterations, and maximising merchants\u0026rsquo; value and developer experience (happy teams = happy product = happy customers!). Afterwards, I got another job change, transitioning to be the tribe lead for the Invoices \u0026amp; Accounting team. This role involves P\u0026amp;L responsibility, as well as accountability on financial results and product evolution. The team size is around 30 FTE - organized in 4 squads + QA, each with an Engineering Manager. We provide mobile app services (from the context of the SumUp SuperApp) as well as web experience. Additionally, I expanded my scope on Engineering, by driving the global Incident Response process. Without direct reports, the responsibility includes to lead the implementation of the processes and tools. The role involves intense collaboration with other functions (such as Risk, Compliance and Operations) to implement the process in a holistic, customer-centric manner. After being focused on growth, aligned with the global economical context in 2023 there was a strong company-wide pivot to profitability. This resulted on achieving a funding round of ‚Ç¨285 million in december, fueling the growth ambition (with a economically sustainable approach). 2019-2021 Technical Lead ‚Üí Engineering Manager VanMoof. Amsterdam, The Netherlands Tech Lead - VanMoof Startup-life VanMoof is a developer and designer of urban e-bikes, with a Direct-to-consumer model. With retail locations in Tokyo, Berlin, San Francisco, London, Paris, Taipei - I joined in the moment that the company started to shape as a scale-up - joining just before the Series-A ($13.5M) and B ($40M) investment rounds. During my work at VanMoof I participated in in-sourcing efforts, to bring technology closer to the core of the company, especially in the digital ecosystem (which included the content and marketing sites, e-commerce systems, ERP, customer support, and other custom-developed solutions both for internal and customer use). The team grew fast while I worked at VanMoof. In the early stage I worked as Tech Lead, focusing in an Individual Contributor track mixed with technical leadership, and participated in in-sourcing the development of the platform and setting up fundaments like continous integration, pull request review processes, or infrastructure as code and 24x7 service. As the team scaled up in the hypergrowth phase, I participated in the organization of the teams, shaping my role as an Engineering Manager, and setting new disciplines (such as QA department, frontend-development), new platforms (such as the definition and launch of the partner network, shaping the collaboration with the development partners Info.nl). 2017-2019 Technical Lead Emakina.NL.

In Emakina.NL I was part of a multidisciplinar agile team, with a cross-functional combination of roles from different providers, and the client, working together. The technical team was up to 10 people, but it was only a part of the whole - which included a dedicated QA engineering team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Business Analysts. The solution I worked on for 2 years was a cross-cloud implementation in SFCC, with a tech stack strongly oriented towards the Salesforce ecosystem: Javascript in the backend and frontend, SASS, Mulesoft \u0026amp; Java as middleware, Azure as the cloud infrastructure, and the Atlassian ecosystem (JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo) for the day to to day. My role as tech lead was to provide solutions that would fit in the technical and functional landscape, ensuring maintainability, quality and the right knowledge distribution in the team. For this, the role included coaching new team members, hands-on (pair) programming, and intensive code review to ensure the highest standards and continuous improvement. It also involved the creation of plannings and estimations, and definitions of roadmaps.

As part of my (team) tasks, I executed mobile and web (high scalability) development projects. I defined the products roadmap, milestones, and plans to achieve the objectives, as well as the talent acquisition. The company focus as an advertisement agency was strongly towards app installs and mobile entertainment, and the product definition spiralled around those verticals.

After years growing Zadia together with my co-founder and partner, I exited the venture with the aim of starting afresh in a new location, new culture, and discover new ways of working. After an evaluation of potential locations where to relocate to, I chose Amsterdam as a city, and The Mobile Company as my company. There I worked with an excellent group of professionals, highly specialised in native, high quality mobile application development for some of the largest apps in the Netherlands.
