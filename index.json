I especially enjoyed reading it after Kahneman\u0026rsquo;s book, to add a bit of color to the \u0026ldquo;cognitive biases\u0026rdquo; more as to what they are: how we think and make decisions. \u0026quot;\nHere’s why these two books are secret weapons for technologists who want to spark passion, and not only \u0026ldquo;convince with data\u0026rdquo;:\n🔥 The Core Tension: Kahneman’s Systems vs. Sutherland’s \u0026ldquo;Psycho-Logic\u0026rdquo; Kahneman maps how we decide: System 1 (intuitive, emotional) and System 2 (logical, deliberate). Engineers adore System 2—it feels safe, optimized, \u0026ldquo;correct.\u0026rdquo; Sutherland rebels: \u0026ldquo;Logic is a rear-view mirror\u0026rdquo;. He argues System 1 drives 90% of decisions, yet we design products/processes for System 2. Result? \u0026ldquo;Factually perfect but emotionally sterile\u0026rdquo; interactions that disengage users—and teams. 🧑🦯 Engineer’s blind spot: We solve for efficiency, not for the human experience of the solution. ⚗️ 3 \u0026ldquo;Alchemical\u0026rdquo; Rules Every Tech Team Should Steal 1. \u0026ldquo;The Opposite of a Good Idea Can Also Be a Good Idea\u0026rdquo;\nExample: Red Bull succeeded because it tasted awful + was overpriced—signalling \u0026ldquo;extreme energy,\u0026rdquo; not just \u0026ldquo;beverage.\u0026rdquo; 🐞* For engineers: Sometimes a \u0026ldquo;flaw\u0026rdquo; (e.g., slower load time for suspense) creates delight. Not every bug needs fixing.* 2. \u0026ldquo;Don’t Design for Average\u0026rdquo; Extreme users reveal more than the \u0026ldquo;rational\u0026rdquo; middle. Example: The sandwich was invented for a gambler who refused to leave cards for a meal.\n⇲ For engineers: Personas are dead. Obsess over edge cases—they’re innovation gold, and averages are a deadly boring and mediocre ground to be placed. 3. \u0026ldquo;A Flower Is Simply a Weed with an Advertising Budget\u0026rdquo;\nPerception \u0026gt; reality. Example: Stripe toothpaste cleans no better—but stripes signal \u0026ldquo;advanced science\u0026rdquo; to our brains.\n🪄For engineers: Data without storytelling is noise. Wrap logic in magic.\n🚫 The Cost of Ignoring \u0026ldquo;Alchemy\u0026rdquo; in Tech Disengagement: Users tolerate \u0026ldquo;logical\u0026rdquo; UX but love \u0026ldquo;irrational\u0026rdquo; ones (e.g., Duolingo’s absurd notifications). Team friction: Engineers who dismiss \u0026ldquo;soft\u0026rdquo; factors create solutions that are precisely wrong vs. vaguely right. Innovation stagnation: As Sutherland warns: \u0026ldquo;Logic kills magic\u0026rdquo;. Blockbuster died optimizing DVD logistics while Netflix sold nostalgia-in-a-red-envelope ✨. 💥 Become a \u0026ldquo;Psycho-Logical\u0026rdquo; Engineer Test the \u0026ldquo;irrational\u0026rdquo;: Add whimsy to a feature (e.g., Slack /shrug). Measure and optimize for emotional response, not just KPIs. Reward \u0026ldquo;alchemy\u0026rdquo; in code reviews: Celebrate solutions that are human-elegant, not just machine-efficient. Study Kahneman + Sutherland as a duo: One gives you the map; the other hands you a machete to blaze new trails and be more impactful. \u0026ldquo;To be brilliant, you have to be irrational.\u0026rdquo; Rory Sutherland\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-07-30-why-engineers-need-alchemy-beyond-factual-correctn/","tags":["linkedin","imported","article"],"title":"🦄 Why Engineers Need \"Alchemy\": Beyond Factual Correctness to Human Magic"},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"The update you were expecting: what comes next?\nWorksome it is 🎉🚀From the moment I spoke with the team, I felt this was special.\nThat rare blend of trust, transparency, and infectious energy — where every conversation radiates purpose and values are aligned, with no effort.The funniest thing?\nWe had spoken years ago - and while the timing wasn\u0026rsquo;t quite right and stayed at SumUp for a bit longer (learning and growing a lot!), I kept an eye on the company trajectory 👀Worksome isn’t just transforming how businesses access global talent; they’re redefining work culture itself.\nWith their focus on flexibility, inclusion, and lightning-fast compliance, it’s clear why 91% of users love their platform.Having felt the pain of incorporating contingent workers into a company (even when budgets allow!), it feels exciting to help smooth this process and change the way we work.\nBeyond excited to contribute to a future where work is truly frictionless and people can spend most of their time doing what they are good at and they love.I had my first day today, and can\u0026rsquo;t hide how awesome it has been.

They’re tangible (easier than fixing trust or educating a team on a topic). We confuse motion with progress (see: The Halo Effect 📚). Even a broken clock gives the correct time twice a day: A broken system optimizes brokenness - regardless of tools\nHow to Actually Scratch the Surface (Hint: leave that research of \u0026ldquo;best tool to do X\u0026rdquo; aside for a bit, dust your brain 🧠)\n🔍 Diagnose FIRST:\nSome of the kinds of problems where it\u0026rsquo;s tempting to trust the promise of \u0026ldquo;one more tool will fix it\u0026rdquo;\n🩸 \u0026ldquo;Initiative anemia\u0026rdquo; → Are teams waiting for permission to fix obvious problems?

I found myself \u0026ldquo;talking\u0026rdquo; to the LLMs as if they were my rubber duck.\nJumping back and forth between the \u0026ldquo;product manager\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;senior developer\u0026rdquo; hats, polishing the product.Not only did I like this, I continued this during odd free hours during my parental leave earlier this year\u0026hellip;I have been amazed by the competition between the IDEs (and the LLMs).\nIn a lapse of months, there have been improvements in agentic modes, visual input, or visual edition (like lovable does).Another thing that amazed me was that I tried earlier this year to program a small app for the Garmin SDK - and the suggestions were just terrible.\nMonths later, I\u0026rsquo;ve given it a new try and in a matter of hours I could craft a QR app for the smartwatches (https://lnkd.in/dwv4bKrp), paired with a simple Go backend (https://lnkd.in/dr_C6AZS).It's easy to make fun of \u0026ldquo;vibe coding\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;lame programming\u0026rdquo;, but to me it has been a chance to focus on \u0026ldquo;what\u0026rdquo; instead of \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo;, as well as allowed me to program without the ability to allocate continuous hours for focus time (which are usually needed to make significant progress).And it has not only been fun, but valuable too: the theme I offer for free has considerably grown in usage. I consider Copilot \u0026amp; Cursor the \u0026ldquo;unnamed contributors\u0026rdquo; that accelerate every step I take to improve the code\u0026hellip; and keep me motivated to do so.And I can also say that I\u0026rsquo;ve embraced vibe coding before it had a name, I\u0026rsquo;m an early adopter 😆#vibecoding #earlyadopter #agenticprogramming #aiassistedprogramming\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2025-05-07-vibe-coding-has-made-programming-fun-for-me-aga/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"Vibe coding has made programming fun for me aga..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there: you want to communicate effectively and use some obvious and harmless acronyms.\nOr that\u0026rsquo;s what you thought\u0026hellip;The bad news?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not only not effective but it might hurt communication.When someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t inmediately get your acronym, any keystrokes you saved are instantly outweighed by:\u0026quot;• Explanation time\u0026quot;• Potential misunderstandings\u0026quot;• Execution errorsAnd the wider the audience and scope of your communication, the more likely this is to happen.\nAcronyms that are obvious for one team get lost in translation as the range of collaboration expands.The real hack?\nText expansion tools.For example: I type \u0026ldquo;BE\u0026rdquo;

You have to make decisions based on incomplete or conflicting information, and communicate them effectively to your team and stakeholders. You also have to deal with the human and emotional aspects of leading people, such as motivating, coaching, and resolving conflicts.\nHow will this benefit you? ✍️ One of the most important skills that can help you navigate these challenges is making explicit the implicit. This means being aware of your own assumptions, beliefs, and biases that influence your thinking and behavior, and sharing them openly with others. By doing this, you can:\nReduce misunderstandings and misalignments. When you make your assumptions explicit, you can check if they are valid and aligned with the reality and the goals of the project. You can also invite feedback and input from others, and learn from different perspectives and experiences. Increase trust and collaboration. When you share your assumptions openly, you show vulnerability and honesty, which are essential for building trust and rapport. You also signal that you are open to learning and changing your mind, which fosters a culture of curiosity and experimentation. Enhance creativity and innovation. When you challenge your assumptions, you can discover new possibilities and opportunities that you might have overlooked or dismissed. You can also generate more diverse and original ideas by combining and integrating different assumptions and perspectives. How do you make it happen? Making explicit the implicit is not easy. It requires a lot of self-awareness, reflection and lots of curiosity, to become aware of what things you are taking for granted that others might overlook, or have a completely different take. It also requires practice, feedback, and being very open to iterating.\n🔭The implicit assumptions can lie in many areas, such as:\nThe best solution should involve a technology-driven solution. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s easier (and cheaper) to solve a problem by applying some extra, manual work. We (software engineers) tend to underestimate the cost of ourselves, and overestimate the frequency in which edge case problems might appear and require intervention. Users will understand the intention of what we are creating for them. We, as creators of a software product, tend to be way more in connection with our creation than our users. We should be aware of the The team members\u0026rsquo; motivations are aligned with ours. We might be trying to solve a problem that others might not be aware of, or give as much relevance as we do. We should align on what we are trying to accomplish, and why. The complexity of the solutions at hand are known by everyone equally. This is a pitfall that I have seen engineers falling endlessly. Explaining the options are hand, and why we had discarded them *intuitively *leads to great conversations, with plenty of \u0026ldquo;what if\u0026rdquo; ideas that might not have crossed our mind initially. 💡Here are some tips to help you develop this skill:\nAsk yourself questions. Before making a decision or taking an action, ask yourself: What am I taking as a given in my decision-making process? What am I assuming? Why am I assuming this? How do I know this is true? What if I\u0026rsquo;m wrong? What are the consequences of this assumption? Write down your assumptions. Writing helps you clarify your thoughts and identify gaps or inconsistencies in your reasoning. It also helps you remember your assumptions and revisit them later. Share your assumptions with others. Seek feedback from people who have different backgrounds, roles, perspectives, or opinions than yours. Ask them to challenge your assumptions or offer alternative ones. Listen actively and respectfully, and be willing to change your mind if needed. Experiment with your assumptions. Test your assumptions by conducting experiments or trying new approaches. Observe the results and learn from them. Adjust your assumptions or actions accordingly. Try to look at the problem as a newcomer. Look at the situation as if you didn\u0026rsquo;t have any context, would you evaluate it in the same way? What information leads to evaluate it in a different way? What learnings are you applying that are not explicitly written down? Wrapping up - what\u0026rsquo;s in for you? Making explicit the implicit is a powerful way to improve your impact as a technology leader, and to drive better decision making. It helps you create an environment where people have factual conversations, and challenge each other in a healthy way - which is key to a psychologically safe environment as well as to a high performance team.It can help you make better decisions, communicate more clearly, lead more authentically, and foster a culture of learning and innovation in your team or organization.\n🤖Credit: image created with Dall-e 3, for the prompt \u0026ldquo;An image that shows a fleet of spaceships exploring the universe together, without any text\u0026rdquo;\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-03-making-explicit-the-implicit-exploring-parallel-un/","tags":["linkedin","imported","article"],"title":"Making explicit the implicit: Exploring parallel universes while creating alignment"},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"New office home!\nSoon we’re ready for a visit - couldn’t be best located 🤩, and better welcomed.\nNext to Vesterport, see you soon for a coffee meeting or a beer at the rooftop 😎\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-01-new-office-home/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"New office home!"},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"New office home!\nSoon we’re ready for a visit - couldn’t be best located 🤩, and better welcomed.Next to Vesterport, see you soon for a coffee meeting or a beer at the rooftop 😎\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-03-01-new-office-homesoon-were-ready-for-a-visit/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"New office home!Soon we’re ready for a visit - ..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"Engineering Managers in my network - the chance to work with Hannah is not one to let pass!I enjoyed so much working with her - and you can do that now in a really interesting product in one of the hottest tech areas: AI for translations 🔥Check the job our for Asterdam, Cologne, Berlin, London - or fully remote (for Germany, Poland or UK too)\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-29-engineering-managers-in-my-network-the-chance/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"Engineering Managers in my network - the chance..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"This.\nWhen a conversation reaches by DM, send it to a channel (either private or public depending on context).\nAnd nudging team members to understand that posting in a public channel is not spamming, given the right etiquette (right tagging - so not @here to say good morning; right context setting, using threads for related follow ups)…\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-26-this/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"This."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"This.When a conversation reaches by DM, send it to a channel (either private or public depending on context).And nudging team members to understand that posting in a public channel is not spamming, given the right etiquette (right tagging - so not @here to say good morning; right context setting, using threads for related follow ups)…\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-26-thiswhen-a-conversation-reaches-by-dm-send-it/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"This.When a conversation reaches by DM, send it..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"🇩🇰Maybe you have seen the SumUp logo and beautiful readers in our Metro in Copenhagen lately? 👀🖤🤍After the first push (https://lnkd.in/d_Cjj4q8), we\u0026rsquo;re now offering 0.49% (ZERO FOURTY NINE PERCENT yes!!) fees in Copenhagen, for merchants that signup in http://sumup.com/da-dk before the end of april.As usual, this is a great effort from many - quite an outcome to be proud of.\nHaving Anders put us in our retail partners is invaluable - where our merchants are shopping already! 🛒\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-19-maybe-you-have-seen-the-sumup-logo-and-beauti/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"🇩🇰Maybe you have seen the SumUp logo and beauti..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"The job itself is interesting (high availability, large amounts of data, enabling many internal and customer-facing use cases\u0026hellip;).\nBut even more of a reason for me to promote and vouch for it is the chance to work with Jake!\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2024-02-14-the-job-itself-is-interesting-high-availabilit/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"The job itself is interesting (high availabilit..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"STOP THE PRESS 🛑\n(ok, now that you have stopped: share with your network and get Karma points with me :-)\nI share some cool jobs from SumUp here and there.

Incentives are not just about giving rewards or punishments, but also about making sure your team members share the same goals, values and behaviors as your organization.\nIncentives can make a big difference in how your organization works, and how people work together, talk to each other and come up with new ideas. Incentives can also help people do better, learn more and grow in their careers.\nBut setting incentives is not trivial. You have to know what each team member needs, wants and likes, as well as what your organization wants to achieve and what challenges it faces. You also have to keep checking and asking if the incentives are working and fair.\nYou need to make sure that individual goals are aligned with behaviours that will lead to positive outcomes for your customers - otherwise, you risk rewarding actions and ways of working that will hurt you in the long run (for example, becoming too bureaucratic or de-attached from what your customers need).\nSome of the questions that I ask myself when setting incentives are:\nWhat do I want my team to achieve? How is our success measured? What are the things that my team members do that help those achievements? How can I show appreciation and recognition for those things? How can I stop or fix the things that my team members do that hurt those achievements? How can I make sure the incentives match the values and culture of my organization? How can I make the incentives fit the different needs and likes of each team member? How can I get feedback and suggestions from my team on the incentives? The answers to these questions will lead you towards the behaviours that you will want to reward and incentivize. If you are thinking \u0026ldquo;this will cost me a lot\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; - you should realized that many times the incentive will not come in an economical way. What actions are you highlighting and praising in public? Are you role modeling the behaviours that you want your teams to also show? Are you giving corrective feedback when you find people acting against the desired ways?\nAn all in all - the strongest motivation will always lie within. In order for the incentives to work and build the behaviours you want to create, they should be internalized. For that, you will need to make sure that people are aligned with the bigger goals, starting with their personal values. Otherwise - any attempt to align these incentives will be on a superficial level (for example: the sense of reward felt is diluted or lost very quickly).\nAlso - Setting incentives is something that will take multiple iterations, and a lot of repetition. You have to keep trying, changing and talking about - the ultimate reward is that by aligning the organizational objectives with customer needs and personal values, you will be able to lead inspired people that work together for the common success.\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-12-17-the-power-of-purposeful-incentives-shaping-behavio/","tags":["linkedin","imported","article"],"title":"The Power of Purposeful Incentives: Shaping Behaviors for Long-Term Success"},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"More fuel to deliver on our vision: to create a world where everyone can build a successful business.\nWhen times have changed, we have changed with them too.\nIt has been inspiring to see how a large team like us has altered course and aimed (and delivered) both profitability and growth.More great things are coming from SumUp, you can be sure!\n🚀#sumup #investment #founding\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2023-12-11-more-fuel-to-deliver-on-our-vision-to-create-a/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"More fuel to deliver on our vision: to create a..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"💳 In a time where payments get more expensive in the Nordics - from SumUp we\u0026rsquo;ve gone the opposite direction, and lowered fees in Denmark to 0.89% (from 1.49%).If you know a small merchant in Denmark that could use lower fees on their payments - drop me a line!

I want to make a case for making empathy a top tool in our skillset.\nEmpathy is the ability to detect and understand other people’s feelings. It’s a skill that we can all improve through training and practice. Empathy is not only good for our personal relationships but also for our professional ones. It can help us reduce stress, build more positive relationships, and even boost revenues.\nHow? By putting ourselves in the shoes of our colleagues, customers, and stakeholders. By trying to see things from their perspective, we can better understand their needs, expectations, and motivations.\nWe can also anticipate potential problems and find solutions that work for everyone.\nAs this is not a skill that we engineers get taught so often let me make a specific case: building empathy is like \u0026ldquo;reverse engineering\u0026rdquo; our colleagues. We have to imagine with which kind of perceptions and values their behaviour would be the most likely. First - we should assume the best intentions from others, and start building their worldview in our mind.\nWe have to ask ourselves: what are they feeling? What are they thinking? What are they trying to achieve? What are the challenges they are facing? What are the opportunities they are seeing? This can help us reflect on the same situation from another angle - leaving the adversarial default aside, and reflecting also how our original point of view would come across to others.\nBy doing this, we can create a sense of connection and trust with them. We can communicate more effectively and respectfully. We can collaborate more productively and creatively. We can also avoid misunderstandings and conflicts that can damage our relationships and our performance.\nEmpathy helps us have more meaningful work relations and allow each one to be ourselves, and assume the best intentions of others. It helps us create a culture of inclusion and belonging, where everyone feels valued and respected. It helps us foster innovation and diversity, where different ideas and perspectives are welcomed and appreciated.\nEmpathy is NOT a \u0026ldquo;soft skill\u0026rdquo; (I really don\u0026rsquo;t like that name anyway as it feels downgrading to its relevance). It’s a must-have skill for any leader or manager who wants to succeed in today’s complex and dynamic world. Empathy is not a weakness. It’s a strength that can make us better professionals and better human beings.\nIf you are interested in the topic, I leave a couple of articles to extend on it:\nThe secret to leading organizational change is empathy, by Patti Sanchez in Harvard Business Review. Why empathy is good for business, by Silvia Castrogiovanni and Elena Pattini in World Economic Forum. 4 ways to communicate with more empathy, by Joel Schwartzberg.

Not only the Apple TV+ comedy series about an American football coach who becomes the manager of a struggling English soccer team - but also Ted Lasso as a fictional leader.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t watched it yet, I highly recommend it. Not only because it\u0026rsquo;s hilarious and heartwarming, but also because it offers some valuable leadership lessons that can be applied to any team or organization.\nHere are some of the things I learned from Ted Lasso and we can all try to apply in our teams:\nBe optimistic and positive. Ted Lasso is always cheerful and upbeat, even when things are going wrong. He never gives up or loses hope, and he inspires his team to do the same. He believes in the power of positivity and kindness to overcome any challenge.\nBe curious and open-minded. Ted Lasso is not afraid to admit what he doesn\u0026rsquo;t know, and he\u0026rsquo;s always eager to learn from others. He listens to different perspectives and opinions, and he respects different cultures and backgrounds. He embraces diversity and inclusion as a source of strength and creativity.\nBe empathetic and compassionate. Ted cares deeply about his players and staff, and he shows it in many ways. He remembers their names and personal details, he asks them how they are doing, he supports them when they are struggling, and he celebrates their successes. He treats everyone with dignity and respect, regardless of their role or status.\nBe humble and authentic. He doesn\u0026rsquo;t pretend to be someone he\u0026rsquo;s not, and he doesn\u0026rsquo;t let his ego get in the way of his mission. He acknowledges his mistakes and apologizes when he\u0026rsquo;s wrong. He\u0026rsquo;s honest and transparent with his team and his boss, and he expects the same from them.\nBe vulnerable and trusting. Ted goes through quite some personal challenges, including dealing with anxiety and situations that he\u0026rsquo;s not sure how to navigate. He trusts his closest team with this, and prioritizes his family when possible to focus on what matters to him.\nBe flexible and adaptable. He\u0026rsquo;s willing to experiment and try new things, even if they seem unconventional or risky. He\u0026rsquo;s not afraid to change his plans or strategies when the situation requires it. He\u0026rsquo;s always looking for ways to improve himself and his team, and he welcomes feedback and suggestions.\nNot only the show is entertaining and full of puns - but it has also helped me reflect on leadership styles, and how being comfortable on your own skin is so important to be authentic and inspire others.\nWhat do you think?

🙊 Let me elaborate on the idea💡 and bring a practical example + a book recommendation (combo!).This lies behind the linguistic relativity hypothesis \u0026ndash; that explores if language influences the way that we think.\nThe idea is that having specific words for something makes us faster at processing it.I find that this comes to practice when working on teams quite often.\nHaving a name, a term, for something - makes it easier to speak about it and have deeper conversations.\nThis is what I find that Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais (Team Topologies) 🇺🇦 helps doing.\nIn the book there is a very good observation on how teams interact, and how they tend to create connections (inner and outside the team boundaries), and how this affects the way of working.In order to explain the ways that teams work, and explain how different ways of working are better for specific purposes - there is a very useful vocabulary, both as words and also as visual representations.\nThe \u0026ldquo;automatic\u0026rdquo; effect that I saw on myself, and others that read the book, is that we can start to think way more in terms of the kind of teams that we work with, and if the ways of working with them are the most appropiate.The concepts themselves are very digestible and intuitive - with the team types being \u0026ldquo;stream-aligned\u0026rdquo;, enabling, \u0026ldquo;complicated sub-system\u0026rdquo;, and platform; and having the following interaction modes between them: collaboration, \u0026ldquo;x-as-a-service\u0026rdquo;, and facilitating.I definitely recommend the book - which is very practical and full of examples, and allows reading specific sections (or revisiting), as it\u0026rsquo;s full of visual content.\nHave you read the book?\nDid you see a similar effect, on \u0026ldquo;enriching the conversation\u0026rdquo;?\nIf not - I hope you do and let me know if you found it useful to have better conversations with your peers!References/read more:\u0026quot;- about the linguistic relativity hypothesis: https://lnkd.in/enhNe4uH\u0026quot;- about Team Topologies: obviously in the book 📖, and also in the additional resources in https://lnkd.in/ek_sZb-S.#teamcollaboration #teamtopologies #vocabulary #collaboration\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-20-being-able-to-define-something-makes-conversati/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"Being able to define something makes conversati..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"You will start seeing these beauties soon at the desk our your favourite local merchants 🤩A beautiful piece of hardware with no strings attached (aka no monthly fees), competitive payment fees, and powerful software running it.\nGreat things to come!\nAfter playing with internal versions with it for a bit I can say that it is exciting to get this into the merchant\u0026rsquo;s hands, can\u0026rsquo;t wait to see how it improves their daily operations!!\n#software #hardware #productlaunch #pointofsale\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-17-you-will-start-seeing-these-beauties-soon-at-th/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"You will start seeing these beauties soon at th..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"I love working in multi cultural environments, across countries, and doing business with all kind of nationalities and backgrounds.

I could understand why some of my preferences had felt off in Spain, and they could feel completely natural in the Netherlands (like the much more flat view on hierarchy, or the appreciation for honest and direct feedback).The book helped me a lot to understand that some things that I took for granted in relations or behaviours were not a \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; for everyone - and were heavily influenced by where I grew up (personal preferences aside).\nAnd the same happens for virtually everyone that grows up and lives in a society, with the invisible and unspoken societal and cultural norms shaping our behaviour and our world view.Day to day I have used the book\u0026rsquo;s guidelines to understand how to cooperate more effectively with colleagues from multiple countries, make them feel more included and respected, and grow a level of empathy on helping me understand better how others thing.If you work in a multi cultural environment, or are interested on learning about how different cultures tackle the same situations - give the book a read!\n#culture #work #empathy\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-11-03-i-love-working-in-multi-cultural-environments/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"I love working in multi cultural environments, ..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"A very interesting and unique position, with almost instant positive impact in the large scale operations of the software/hardware product.\nLots of collaboration, and working in complex and interesting problems to solve ahead.And the team is great too - if you want more info don\u0026rsquo;t doubt to reach out, I can put you in contact!\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2022-09-30-a-very-interesting-and-unique-position-with-al/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"A very interesting and unique position, with al..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"This was quite a blast.

I see myself on a pic in the company slack and think \u0026ldquo;how unflattering it is\u0026rdquo;. I had moved to Amsterdam and lost my exercise routine, consisting in playing football with my friends at the local league.\nBut I had to accept it: the pic was not unflattering - I came to terms with it and started running, because it was very convenient: no gym subscription, no schedules, and could go out any time. Only one downside: I hated it. It was the part I disliked the most of football training - but somehow I convinced myself \u0026ldquo;endure, focus on smaller objectives and just do it\u0026rdquo;. So I\u0026rsquo;d focus on getting to the next street light, to the next crossing - and celebrate small achievements: \u0026ldquo;today I ran 1km without stopping\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;my longest run of 5km!\u0026rdquo;, and so on.\nFast forward, it\u0026rsquo;s 2021 and I have finished by first long distance triathlon (or Ironman, isn\u0026rsquo;t it a sexier name?), after having endured 2 years of training during the pandemic, and having stubbornly fixated on getting to the finish line on time.\nHow did that even happen!? I give a lot of credit to the power of building habits. That\u0026rsquo;s the magic of transforming a crazy impossible idea into a set of steps towards the goal (lots of steps, yes, but repetition makes perfect!). It did help to have an objective and to start applying structured training when I completed by first marathon in 2018 - that was my first taste of how powerful was the concept of \u0026ldquo;divide and conquer\u0026rdquo; to fitness goals too.\nTo complete such a long race I wanted to change the approach of \u0026ldquo;just run however you feel like\u0026rdquo; - and start applying a more scientific method to my training: focusing on slowly and steadily building up the volume of my trainings, the distance, and working at the right intensity.\nI did feel like I was not making enough progress at the time - but I followed the advice of my coach Pablo and \u0026ldquo;trust the process\u0026rdquo;. After finishing, I told him my \u0026ldquo;secret ambition\u0026rdquo; of finishing a Long Distance Triathlon, and Ironman.\nI learned a lot on the process of preparing for it, mainly about myself. Many of the learnings I can take them with me to multiple life situations, including business.\n📆 the power of planning: that would work at multiple levels. From a season planning focused on the year, to the weekly and daily sessions. It could feel overwhelming and exhausting to have such a detailed plan - but actually that\u0026rsquo;s what helped to be able to adapt and be flexible when needed. Sickness and having to lose one day? No problem - the trick is the long term - making sure that even if I had to skip a session for whatever reason, the big plan wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get affected. Same as good planning and preparation helps overcome incidents on a project. 🏆 sharing my goals and my successes: what\u0026rsquo;s the point of achieving anything big, if it\u0026rsquo;s not to celebrate with the ones that support me? Same as with business goals - sharing my objectives with my team helps make them a collective victory that we can all celebrate. Of course Triathlon is an individual sport so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t fully project, but the shared training sessions with club mates, being transparent on my planning and adapting it with my partner\u0026hellip; helps to get a support network that roots for me too! 🤷‍♂️ accept the unexpected: it doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter how much preparation you have done, when you confront an endurance fitness event where you\u0026rsquo;ll exercise for longer than 11h there will be unexpected situations. Caused by weather, mechanics, your own body, \u0026hellip; There\u0026rsquo;s no point on focusing on how things could have been - better to use that energy on dealing with the hand that you got, and making the best of it. ⛈ train in similar conditions to the race day: the day of the event there was a hell of a weather in Italy. Lots of rain, a huge storm, sliding conditions on the road. But I didn\u0026rsquo;t panic - I had cycled on that kind of weather in the Netherlands or Denmark! Same as you can try to be ready for adverse situations at work by \u0026ldquo;practicing\u0026rdquo; and solving daily issues (let\u0026rsquo;s say, smaller incidents, dealing with conflicts, etc) - to prepare for the \u0026ldquo;big day\u0026rdquo;, whatever that day might be. Flipping the switch from \u0026ldquo;this situation is annoying\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;this can be a good learning opportunity or training\u0026rdquo; changes the point from the situation being a hassle to a moment for self-improvement. 🚶‍♂️ I will not enjoy every day - but the journey is what matters: when you want to achieve a long term goal it\u0026rsquo;s very likely that there will be days that challenge the motivation, or even why I am doing what I do. It\u0026rsquo;s very important to have intrinsic motivation, goals that come from myself - instead of doing what I do for external recognition or factors that I can\u0026rsquo;t control. 💪 I\u0026rsquo;m stronger than I think I am: being able to achieve something that only some years ago I didn\u0026rsquo;t consider possible has taught me a lot about myself. Putting the head down, focusing on a goal and just enduring with the day by day does the trick - always keeping the eye on the long term goal and believing in myself, because I have proven myself what I\u0026rsquo;m capable of when I just go on. What\u0026rsquo;s next after such a long journey? Looking for what keeps me motivated and engaged, and doing more of that!

The team I joined had been part of a previous acquisition of SumUp (Debitoor): merging cultures and integrating into the overall company was a big challenge.\nAt SumUp I got hands-on with a more complex organizational setup and map, with a tribalized setup; and highly enjoyed the reflective spirit of the company when finding new ways of working.\nLater, I got promoted to Director of Engineering, overseeing the engineering department of the Invoices Tribe (and its two products, SumUp Invoices \u0026amp; Accounting). As part of the Tribe leadership, I worked on aligning technology and product to ensure a solid foundation for quick iterations, and maximising merchants\u0026rsquo; value and developer experience (happy teams = happy product = happy customers!).\nAfterwards, I got another job change, transitioning to be the tribe lead for the Invoices \u0026amp; Accounting team. This role involves P\u0026amp;L responsibility, as well as accountability on financial results and product evolution.\nThe team size is around 30 FTE - organized in 4 squads + QA, each with an Engineering Manager. We provide mobile app services (from the context of the SumUp SuperApp) as well as web experience.\nAdditionally, I expanded my scope on Engineering, by driving the global Incident Response process. Without direct reports, the responsibility includes to lead the implementation of the processes and tools. The role involves intense collaboration with other functions (such as Risk, Compliance and Operations) to implement the process in a holistic, customer-centric manner.\nAfter being focused on growth, aligned with the global economical context in 2023 there was a strong company-wide pivot to profitability. This resulted on achieving a funding round of €285 million in december, fueling the growth ambition (with a economically sustainable approach).\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/experience/sumup/","tags":null,"title":"VP of Engineering \u0026 Tribe Lead - SumUp"},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"After 1 year and a half my relationship with VanMoof changes: from Tech Lead to Brand Ambassador 🚲 (in other words, I\u0026rsquo;m leaving the company ;-)It has been intense, with funding rounds, new product launches (S3/X3, powerbank), trail-blazing features (Find My network support 🍏)\u0026hellip; and a lot of fun on the go.\nAnd all this during a worldwide pandemic and an explosion on bike demand 🤯I started with a focus on the digital ecosystem, improving the tech foundation (monitoring, infrastructure, SLAs, providers, etc) and boy, we\u0026rsquo;ve come a long way.\nFrom single instances with scalability and reliability issues to a DevOps culture in AWS, with constant and frequent releases, automated testing, incident reporting and a culture big on growing knowledge and ownership.The time has gone fast - but I\u0026rsquo;d like to especially thank the Digital Team for how much fun we\u0026rsquo;ve had and how much we\u0026rsquo;ve learned together - and even more to everyone I\u0026rsquo;ve been lucky to have reporting to me and manage.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve made me realise that I was missing managing people, coaching and being \u0026ldquo;an enabler\u0026rdquo;.What comes next?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for big changes!

I believe that at Emakina.NL we know how to make the best of them! #onedayatwork #lastfriday #fridayatemakina. I\u0026rsquo;ve written this article on the Saturday morning, because it seemed unreal how much fun I had at the office - not only with my workmates, but with clients, friends and visitors. I want to capture that day to revisit it any moment :-)\nYesterday it was a pretty cool Friday, with a sprint coming to an end (after two weeks of work), and that involved:\nstandup, with many of the teammates from our client that came to the office to join us\nafter closing the latest pull requests on the project, and merging and deploying them, we had demo - also with many people from the client joining us (in person and remotely) to give feedback to the latest work and see the latest progress\nAs the day was coming to an end, we opened the first beer at the top floor, in the balcony to celebrate the week - and Friday was only continuing! I gave a talk, in one of Emakina\u0026rsquo;s Nerdsummit events, when we share knowledge about some of the technologies or findings we\u0026rsquo;ve made. I spoke about Terraform, and other topics we\u0026rsquo;ve covered were serverless computing, Virtual Reality, or the ELK stack.\nOver? Oh no! As we have a quite some international crew, we had dinner (pizzas, on the company!) with some drinks (did I mention we have our own tap beer!), and watched together the World Cup match of Portugal vs Spain (what a match, 3-3!).\nAnd before going home, some gaming night with the Oculus, playing BeatSaber (if you have a chance to try it, do it, it\u0026rsquo;s damn fun!)\nhttps://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipN0mphwaNGrTU3j67PZ50PPL2upyRqK-Gm7hj-xE_kNNO4SFyIVDqO8Bi2nM4_tZw?key=emNxcTRFOEtpZlRVemc5NUFwU2JWN29VbklBWlN3 (the shouting on the back were because of an apparently exciting pool game, nobody was hurt during the VR experience - we gave Seth a good security radius 😂)\nAnd this weekend I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking our company\u0026rsquo;s boat for a ride, on the Amsterdam canals.

The technical team was up to 10 people, but it was only a part of the whole - which included a dedicated QA engineering team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Business Analysts.\nThe solution I worked on for 2 years was a cross-cloud implementation in SFCC, with a tech stack strongly oriented towards the Salesforce ecosystem: Javascript in the backend and frontend, SASS, Mulesoft \u0026amp; Java as middleware, Azure as the cloud infrastructure, and the Atlassian ecosystem (JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo) for the day to to day.\nMy role as tech lead was to provide solutions that would fit in the technical and functional landscape, ensuring maintainability, quality and the right knowledge distribution in the team. For this, the role included coaching new team members, hands-on (pair) programming, and intensive code review to ensure the highest standards and continuous improvement. It also involved the creation of plannings and estimations, and definitions of roadmaps.\nAs a side track at Emakina.NL I also participated in some public speaking sessions, internally and also externally:\nWeb Accessibility Live 2018, organised by SiteImprove in Amsterdam: https://siteimprove.com/nl-nl/events/web-accessibility-live-2018/, with a talk about the technical implementation of the accessibility requirements in a e-commerce project.

office in Amsterdam, at Pocket Media we shared also some of our knowledge, focused on the new topic for us: Native Ads.\nObviously, without my fantastic explanations (just joking) the conversation loses some interest - but the message I wanted to deliver was: Native Ads are a chance the Advertising Industry is having to make things right. Users block ads more and more every day, because they are annoying.\nNative Advertising is a chance to make ads relevant for the users, non obstructive and, who knows, even enjoyable. They need to deliver value to the users, and even more importantly - not bother the users! What brand wants to be associated with a negative feeling, while you are trying to attract customers to your offers?\nAnd on the publishers side, this is a chance to deliver a tailor made advertising experience to the users. Native Ads give control to the publishers - because they know their audience, what they want, and what they don\u0026rsquo;t.\nAnd to finish, that\u0026rsquo;s what we\u0026rsquo;ve tried to achieve at Pocket Media Native Ads. We\u0026rsquo;ve made an advertising platform for publishers to monetize their audience without giving away any control, helping them to create smooth advertising experiences for their users. If you have apps or websites, and want to earn some extra cash but not bothering your users - try it out!\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2016-04-13-native-ads-or-another-chance-to-make-ads-right-for/","tags":["linkedin","imported","article"],"title":"Native Ads or another chance to make ads right for the users"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Flash-talk, in pechakucha format presentation, with 30 seconds per slide (12 slides total).\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/public-speaking/2013-04-16-pocketmedia-native-ads/","tags":null,"title":"Native Advertising"},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"If you are around the MWC in Barcelona, go and say hi to our team mates!\nOur booth is 8.1G61\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2016-02-22-if-you-are-around-the-mwc-in-barcelona-go-and/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"If you are around the MWC in Barcelona, go and ..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"At Pocket Media we are looking for a new colleague, to join us as Business Analyst, to drill down into our data, make sense in the information, and help us improve our processes.\nAnd we are a great group of people to have as workmates!\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2016-02-19-at-pocket-media-we-are-looking-for-a-new-collea/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"At Pocket Media we are looking for a new collea..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"Nice guys to work with (and even better if you a looking for a Ruby on Rails job)!\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2016-01-11-nice-guys-to-work-with-and-even-better-if-you/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"Nice guys to work with (and even better if you ..."},{"categories":["Professional"],"contents":"It would be cool having real time updates for billboards or TV ads depending on the real-life conditions, like time of the day, weather, etc.\nAnd all that powered by programmatic real-time bidding so advertisers can choose what to display at any moment!\n","permalink":"https://www.adrianmoreno.info/blog/2015-11-02-it-would-be-cool-having-real-time-updates-for-b/","tags":["linkedin","imported","share"],"title":"It would be cool having real time updates for b..."},{"categories":null,"contents":"First time leading a multi-cultural team At Pocket Media I lead the tech team of the company, in a process of product creation and launch to market.

Engineering Leader Based in Copenhagen 🇩🇰, I work at Worksome, a Danish company redefining how businesses and independent professionals collaborate. Our mission is to enable frictionless, compliant, and global access to top talent—empowering companies to adapt to the future of work. A specialized generalist at heart, I bring a unique blend of expertise across backend systems, mobile development, and infrastructure. Over my career, I've led teams of all sizes—from hands-on coding to scaling engineering organizations—always grounded in the 3P framework: People, Product, Process.I'm passionate about building high-performing teams rooted in psychological safety, continuous learning, and meaningful impact. Whether it's refining delivery practices or mentoring future leaders, I focus on shaping environments where both products and people thrive. Contact me Who am I? An engineer at heart and a problem-solver by nature, I channel curiosity and energy into creating technology that simplifies lives. Leadership, for me, means rolling up my sleeves: you'll find me debugging code with engineers one hour and aligning product strategy the next. I'm a deliberate generalist, a T-shaped professional with a hybrid toolkit: part technical architect, part team builder. After founding a startup, I learned to bridge business vision and technical execution—scaling systems, mentoring teams, and advocating for user-centric design. My leadership thrives on three principles: Iterative Improvement: I foster teams that treat progress as a cycle of experimentation, feedback, and refinement.Radical Transparency: From blocks to wins, I believe open communication builds trust and aligns goals.Empathy as a Superpower: Understanding diverse perspectives—whether engineers, clients, or end-users—fuels better decisions and stronger collaboration.My superpower? Versatility. From architecting backend systems (Node.js, Java or PHP) or mobile apps, to optimizing CI/CD pipelines, I connect dots across disciplines to build products that resonate. But technology alone isn't the answer: I obsess over how teams work, fostering environments where psychological safety and iterative learning drive innovation. Education 2004-2007 University of Santiago de Compostela Technical Engineering in Computer Systems 2008-2010 University of Santiago de Compostela Master in Projects Management 2025-present Head of Software Worksome. Copenhagen, Denmark Worksome Joined a Danish startup revolutionizing the future of work In July 2025, I joined Worksome, a Danish startup focused on transforming how companies and freelancers connect and work together. Based in Copenhagen, Worksome is building innovative solutions for the modern workforce, creating a platform that streamlines the process of finding, hiring, and managing freelance talent. At Worksome, I\u0026rsquo;m leveraging my experience in engineering leadership to help scale the technology organization and drive product innovation. Working in a fast-paced startup environment allows me to contribute to both strategic direction and hands-on implementation of key initiatives. The role combines my passion for building high-performing engineering teams with the opportunity to shape the future of work in an increasingly freelance-oriented global economy. 2021-2025 Engineering Manager → VP of Engineering \u0026amp; Tribe Lead SumUp. Copenhagen, Denmark VP of Engineering \u0026amp; Tribe Lead - SumUp Moved to Denmark, joined an European Unicorn 🦄 After relocating from Amsterdam to Copenhagen - I joined SumUp to work in the danish headquarters as an Engineering Manager for the Accounting Squad, in the Merchant Growth Tribe. The team I joined had been part of a previous acquisition of SumUp (Debitoor): merging cultures and integrating into the overall company was a big challenge. At SumUp I got hands-on with a more complex organizational setup and map, with a tribalized setup; and highly enjoyed the reflective spirit of the company when finding new ways of working. Later, I got promoted to Director of Engineering, overseeing the engineering department of the Invoices Tribe (and its two products, SumUp Invoices \u0026amp; Accounting). As part of the Tribe leadership, I worked on aligning technology and product to ensure a solid foundation for quick iterations, and maximising merchants\u0026rsquo; value and developer experience (happy teams = happy product = happy customers!). Afterwards, I got another job change, transitioning to be the tribe lead for the Invoices \u0026amp; Accounting team. This role involves P\u0026amp;L responsibility, as well as accountability on financial results and product evolution. The team size is around 30 FTE - organized in 4 squads + QA, each with an Engineering Manager. We provide mobile app services (from the context of the SumUp SuperApp) as well as web experience. Additionally, I expanded my scope on Engineering, by driving the global Incident Response process. Without direct reports, the responsibility includes to lead the implementation of the processes and tools. The role involves intense collaboration with other functions (such as Risk, Compliance and Operations) to implement the process in a holistic, customer-centric manner. After being focused on growth, aligned with the global economical context in 2023 there was a strong company-wide pivot to profitability. This resulted on achieving a funding round of €285 million in december, fueling the growth ambition (with a economically sustainable approach). 2019-2021 Technical Lead → Engineering Manager VanMoof. Amsterdam, The Netherlands Tech Lead - VanMoof Startup-life VanMoof is a developer and designer of urban e-bikes, with a Direct-to-consumer model. With retail locations in Tokyo, Berlin, San Francisco, London, Paris, Taipei - I joined in the moment that the company started to shape as a scale-up - joining just before the Series-A ($13.5M) and B ($40M) investment rounds. During my work at VanMoof I participated in in-sourcing efforts, to bring technology closer to the core of the company, especially in the digital ecosystem (which included the content and marketing sites, e-commerce systems, ERP, customer support, and other custom-developed solutions both for internal and customer use). The team grew fast while I worked at VanMoof. In the early stage I worked as Tech Lead, focusing in an Individual Contributor track mixed with technical leadership, and participated in in-sourcing the development of the platform and setting up fundaments like continous integration, pull request review processes, or infrastructure as code and 24x7 service. As the team scaled up in the hypergrowth phase, I participated in the organization of the teams, shaping my role as an Engineering Manager, and setting new disciplines (such as QA department, frontend-development), new platforms (such as the definition and launch of the partner network, shaping the collaboration with the development partners Info.nl). 2017-2019 Technical Lead Emakina.NL. Amsterdam, The Netherlands Technical Lead - Emakina.NL Agency-life Emakina.NL is a digital agency with a strong focus in e-commerce and enterprise content management systems. Emakina.NL is a strategic solution partner for Salesforce Commerce Cloud (https://blog.emakina.com/2017/06/20/emakina-salesforce-commerce-cloud-partner/), and has also experience in cross-cloud solutions across the Salesforce ecosystem. In Emakina.NL I was part of a multidisciplinar agile team, with a cross-functional combination of roles from different providers, and the client, working together. The technical team was up to 10 people, but it was only a part of the whole - which included a dedicated QA engineering team, Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Business Analysts. The solution I worked on for 2 years was a cross-cloud implementation in SFCC, with a tech stack strongly oriented towards the Salesforce ecosystem: Javascript in the backend and frontend, SASS, Mulesoft \u0026amp; Java as middleware, Azure as the cloud infrastructure, and the Atlassian ecosystem (JIRA, Confluence, Bamboo) for the day to to day. My role as tech lead was to provide solutions that would fit in the technical and functional landscape, ensuring maintainability, quality and the right knowledge distribution in the team. For this, the role included coaching new team members, hands-on (pair) programming, and intensive code review to ensure the highest standards and continuous improvement. It also involved the creation of plannings and estimations, and definitions of roadmaps. As a side track at Emakina.NL I also participated in some public speaking sessions, internally and also externally: Web Accessibility Live 2018, organised by SiteImprove in Amsterdam: https://siteimprove.com/nl-nl/events/web-accessibility-live-2018/, with a talk about the technical implementation of the accessibility requirements in a e-commerce project. Continuous Delivery Amsterdam, https://www.meetup.com/Continuous-Delivery-Amsterdam/events/247988829/, with a talk about CD/CI in Salesforce Commerce Cloud. 2015-2017 CTO Pocket Media. Amsterdam, The Netherlands CTO - Pocket Media First time leading a multi-cultural team At Pocket Media I lead the tech team of the company, in a process of product creation and launch to market. I was a member of the management team of the company, and lead up to 10 FTE, in charge of hiring, role definition, and performance management. As part of my (team) tasks, I executed mobile and web (high scalability) development projects. I defined the products roadmap, milestones, and plans to achieve the objectives, as well as the talent acquisition. The company focus as an advertisement agency was strongly towards app installs and mobile entertainment, and the product definition spiralled around those verticals. The focus of the native advertisement platform we developed was in customisability, ease to adopt by mobile and web developers and media, and transparency towards the partners. 2015 Senior Mobile Apps Developer (iOS \u0026amp; Android) The Mobile Company. Amsterdam, The Netherlands Mobile Apps Developer - The Mobile Company First job abroad By 2015 I was looking for a life change - and this was accompanied by a professional \u0026ldquo;reinvention\u0026rdquo;. After years growing Zadia together with my co-founder and partner, I exited the venture with the aim of starting afresh in a new location, new culture, and discover new ways of working. After an evaluation of potential locations where to relocate to, I chose Amsterdam as a city, and The Mobile Company as my company. There I worked with an excellent group of professionals, highly specialised in native, high quality mobile application development for some of the largest apps in the Netherlands. At TMC I developed innovative new apps (ie: using Bluetooth BLE beacons technology, which in 2015 was an emerging technology) and also maintained apps with a large and complex codebase and numerous users, among top Dutch apps. I helped tackling complex problems and long-standing bugs, and participated in an agile teams that included the client.
